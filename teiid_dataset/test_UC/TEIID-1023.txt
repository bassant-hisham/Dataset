Chanage "MaxResultRows" Connector Property to default to "unlimited"
Teiid supports a property called "MaxResultRows" in Connector
properties, which defaults to 10,000 rows. The expected behavior of this
is to throw an exception when user queries more than 10,000 rows through
this connector.

However, this default behavior seems like a exceptional condition than
normal behavior expected by user any time. This *was* designed more for
the development time aid than the runtime.

Here is an example of community user tripping over it.

I propose, we change the default value of this property to "-1" that
means the "MaxResultRows" will be set to "unlimited" in the default
scenario. If user requires to restrict max rows they can *explicitly*
set a value that they are comfortable with.

Note the default "unlimited" is value changed from "0" to "-1".
