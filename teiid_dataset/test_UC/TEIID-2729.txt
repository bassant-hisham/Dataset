Dynamic VDB xml requires sibling elements to be in a certain order
In my *-vdb.xml, I have a model defined per following snippet:

<model name="myModel" type="PHYSICAL" visible="true">
    <source name="myModel" translator-name="hive" connection-jndi-name="Hive12Src" />
    <property name="trimColumnNames" value="true" />
</model>

The vdb.xml failed to parse, so I moved the <property> element ahead of <source> and then it worked.

I don't think element ordering should matter in this case?
