HANA MIN and MAX functions not applicable on boolean
SAP HANA doesn't support MIN and MAX functions for BOOLEAN type.
Compared to postgresql, which also has BOOLEAN data type, it seems inconsistent, as postgresql translator mimics MIN and MAX functions by translating them using PostgreSQL specific constructs:
min(BooleanValue) as bool_and(BooleanValue)
max(BooleanValue) as bool_or(BooleanValue)

Similar issue is with CEILING and FLOOR functions.
