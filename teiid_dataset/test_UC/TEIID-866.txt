AdminShell is not able to handle SELECT * INTO #TEMP FROM foo; (statement does not return a result set)
Here's the crux of the issue:

select * into #temp from bqt1.smalla;
// Error: // Uncaught Exception: TargetError : at Line: 165 : in file: URL: jar:file:/home/pnittel/teiid62/adminshell/lib/teiid-adminshell-6.2.0.jar!/scripts/jdbc.bsh : throw e ; 

Target exception: com.metamatrix.jdbc.MMSQLException: Statement does not return a result set.

Steve H. put it this way:
"The into clause turns the statement into an insert, which does not have a result set - it only returns an update count.  It does seem like AdminShell should handle that case.  It's probably doing some parsing of the command and expecting it to return a resultset..."

This same statement works fine in SQL Explorer.
