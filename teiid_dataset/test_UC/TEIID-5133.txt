XmlTable path language is not always identical to XPathValue expressions
The same Path value, used in XPathValue and XmlTable->Path brings different results.
That is for the following query:
{code:sql}
Select * From
    (select '<root>
        <item>
            <id>id1</id>
            <val>val1</val>
        </item>
    </root>' as resp) w,
    XMLTABLE(
        '/root' passing XMLPARSE(document w.resp) columns
        valOption2 string PATH 'item[id = "id1"]/val'
        --,valOption1 string PATH 'item[id/text() = "id1"]/val'
    ) x;;
{code} 
returned value for "valOption2" will be changed from "val1" to "null" that is incorrect and unexpected behavior.
Using "node/text()" in Path expressions may result in side effects.
