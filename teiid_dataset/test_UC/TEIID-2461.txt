Better determine when to block on the output buffer
The output buffer size limitation helps prevent forward only results from unnecessarily consuming resources, but it also may slow down the processing of otherwise already buffered results - which will hold those and other downstream resources unnecessarily.  We should examine the plan to see if this is possible before allowing the output buffer to be size limited.
