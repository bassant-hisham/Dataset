Excel translator and dynamic filenames
Hi all,

All samples I've reached on how to setup a connection to xls files, set up file names as properties in the source model:

    ...  
    <property name="importer.ExcelFileName" value="names.xls"/>  
    ...  

Is there any way to specify filenames dynamically at run-time? 

Best regards
