Minor costing updates
Virtual cost stats for ndv and nnv should be used if available
nnv and ndv should be able to be calculated against projected expressions
External use of useskey should check for intervening joins/unions
The like cost check for just % should be moved to the rewriter
Except/Intersect costing should be based upon average case

This will be about as far as the current logic can be used, see TEIID-239 for using better estimates of ndv and nnv
