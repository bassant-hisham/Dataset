Development with Embedded teiid should not require dependency on EAP
We are using Embedded and specifically ModelMetaData, for specifying VDB. 

ModelMetaData class comes from teiid-admin project, which pulls in a lot of AS dependencies, some of which are only available from earlyrelease maven repo.

For example - org.jboss.as:jboss-as-parent:pom:7.4.0.Final-redhat-4

So essentially users developing against released teiid API (using ModelMetaData) now have dependency on earlyaccess repo. 

Where I work the people who manage the internal company repo do not like proxying non-release repos, and so this causes a bit of a pain.
