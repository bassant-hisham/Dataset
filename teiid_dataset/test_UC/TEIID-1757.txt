Add Support for OData Data Sources
OData data sources, like SAP Gateway, should be consumable by Teiid. I suggest either a new translator or extending the existing web service translator to enable the OData protocol. A new translator would be cleaner, but since OData uses REST, it may not make sense to to have another translator.
