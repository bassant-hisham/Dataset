Add SPATIAL_REF_SYS table
Implement SPATIAL_REF_SYS table (from the OGC Simple Features spec). This table stores metadata about different coordinate systems and how to tranform between them. See [here|http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SRID] and [here|http://www.carocoops.org/resources/doc/postgis/x321.html] for details.

CREATE TABLE SPATIAL_REF_SYS
(
    SRID      INTEGER   NOT NULL PRIMARY KEY,
    AUTH_NAME CHARACTER VARYING(256),
    AUTH_SRID INTEGER,
    SRTEXT    CHARACTER VARYING(2048)
)

This would be used in conjunction with the GeoTools referencing module or Proj4J to transform between coordinate systems in Teiid (ST_Transform function).
