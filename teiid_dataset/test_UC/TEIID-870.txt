Standardize the JDBC metadata
The current JDBC metadata:
catalog = null
schema = vdbname (except when getSchemas is used, then it's reported as model name)
table = table full name

proposed change (which is much closer to what was done for OA ODBC metadata):
catalog = vdbname
schema = model name
table = the rest of the table name including "." if a schema/catalog is in the model
