Unhandled exceptions during close can hang the client
Although rare (generally due to unrelated code issues), an unhandled exception during attemptClose in requestworkitem will not result in the client being sent a response.  This is fine if the close was issued by the client, since it is effectively asynch.  However if the client is waiting for a response (such as when the close is triggered by an asynch cancel), that can hang the client.
