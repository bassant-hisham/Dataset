Create new system function to dump temp table contents to file.  
A requirement to produce a CSV file reflecting the contents of a query result set so it can be subsequently FTP'd or email'd. In Nov 07 implemented this feature using the exec connector, a shell script and mods to JDBCISQL.  

Suggested capability:  function will take the following parameters:
- Temp table name as string
- Target file name (path qualified) as string
- Delimiter as string

When invoked, the specified temp table contents will be written out to the specified file using the specified delimiter to separate the column values.
This generic capability will allow the CSV file thats needed and subsequently process it with other UDF functionality as necessary.

Open questions:
1. How does file path behave in a clustered environment?  Is it relative to the MM Server install dir or fully qualified?

Suggest this feature remain undocumented for the short term.
