Rename the teiid-embedded project to teiid-runtime
Now, that Teiid have single kit for both Embedded and Server, it is
confusing to call it "embedded" kit. So, we need to re-name this kit to
something else. 

Rename the "teiid-embedded" project to "teiid-runtime"

also, rename kit "teiid-embedded" to just "teiid"
