More incremental join when a limit is present
For SQL like:

SELECT 
     t1.column1, 
     t2.column1
FROM 
     schema1.table1 t1, 
     schema2.table1 t2
WHERE 
     t1.column2=t2.column2
LIMIT 100

Teiid may get the whole schema1.table1 content and the whole schema2.table1 content, do the join in memory and then, limit the resultset to 100 records.

However, I think teiid can fetch smaller set of data then do a join.  If the join result set is less than number of rows asking,  keep fetching next set of data and do a join until hits the limit number.
