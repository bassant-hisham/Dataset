JDBC Translator | Incorrect Update count reported on Batched Update Execution
Issue is related to Batched updates scenario.

Typically, the executeBatch() returns an array of integers, and each element of the array represents the update count for the respective update statement.

However in case of Teiid JDBC Translator, over and above this, we are processing the array to return a sum of all the elements as in seen in JDBCUpdateExecution -> executeTranslatedCommand method

 int[] results = pstatement.executeBatch();
 for (int i=0; i<results.length; i++) {
updateCount += results[i];
}

The bug is logged to fix this to meet the standard behaviour
