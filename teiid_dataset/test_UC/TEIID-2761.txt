Enable/disable transport per model/view/virtual procedure
It would be nice to be able to enable and disable access to models, tables, views or (virtual) procedures for a specific transport (JDBC, ODBC, OData, REST, Web services).
One may want to have access to virtual procedures only by Odata for example.
