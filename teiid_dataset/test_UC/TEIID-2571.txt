Generally allow must pushdown function evaluation
A must pushdown function not associated with an access node will fail to evaluate.  We can initially improve upon this with translator that support "select without from" to issue a scalar select of the value.

We can also enhance planning to group all such accesses to prevent multiple calls and to determine a possible source target if the function is not associated with a source schema.
