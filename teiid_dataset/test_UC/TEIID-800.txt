Teiid char type should be consistently treated as char(1)
It looks like there was some initial design confusion with the Teiid character type in that it should map to the SQL char type (more specifically char(1)).  However we added the restriction that an empty string produces an exception.  This behavior is not supported by any database.  To make the type consistent with sources and to allow for eventually supporting lengths other than 1, we should treat our char type as char(1) - for the stringtochar conversion we convert empty string to ' ' and the ascii function should return null for empty string (that's the common behavior for Sybase/SQL Server/Oracle but MySQL returns 0).
