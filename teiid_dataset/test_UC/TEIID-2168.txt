SessionAware cache needs to use Infinispan as Cache Store always
Currently SessionAwareCache uses the Infinispan cache factory for the distributed cache results and uses the Teiid defined DefaultCache for local storage of session scoped results.

The usage of DefaultCache should be entirely removed and replaced with Infinispan's non-replicated local cache. This provides more consistent implementation of the cache store with better eviction policies.
