xml stream handling is inconsistent
Our SQLXMLImpl allows for a variety of source types - such as a streamsource coming from the xml source connector.  However if the resulting SQLXML is used by the client (and not immediately consumed by something like XQuery) then the stream can only be read once.  Also all of the conversion routines in the XMLTranslator logic (and in the xml document stylesheet application) are based upon full materialization.  This may lead to memory problems.  In general our SQLXMLImpl should be backed by a string if small and a (temp) file if large.  Conversions from DOM and SAX sources would also need to create temp files to protect memory and allow for multiple reads respectively.
