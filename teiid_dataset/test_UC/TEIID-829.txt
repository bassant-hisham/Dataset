revamp code table caching
Code tables have several design issues:

1. the cache should allow for eviction and possibly expiration.

2. the cache should be backed by the common caching facility.

3. should allow for explicit scoping - at a minimum global vs. vdb, but additional may be good to allow session and request.

4. the implementation should be minimally blocking (in terms of both query execution and use of synchronization).
