Performance issue retrieving data source and translator definitions through the AdminFactory
Based on the issue described in  TEIIDDES-2592, we discovered that connecting to a remote server that contained ~ 40 data sources required > 10 minutes to refresh the Server view in Teiid Designer.  After some debugging it appeared that some of the current behavior in AdminFactory results multiple redundant CLI calls to retrieve intermediate information to compile even a simple list of data source names.

In Teiid Designer, we modified our forked Admin8Factory to define a few cached sets of data that get cleared if data is changed by our ExecutionAdmin class for any created or deleted data sources.

Note that Designer's Server management paradigm includes the requirement to view the DS/Translator/VDB contents on the server.

So I'm assuming that there could be some benefit if Teiid AdminFactory adapted a similar approach to improving the performance/behavior of the internal methods of this class.
