Memory handling improvements
The buffermanager will create softreferences for batches that prefer memory, but does not track the memory as held once the value has been passivated.

Also small lobs, such as xml values created via sqlxml, should be inlined into results for greater performance - and so that they can be paged out by the buffermanager rather than being held by a lobmanager.
