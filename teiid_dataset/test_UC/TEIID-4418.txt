Pushdown of a correlated with clause contains wrong correlated reference
A query such as:

{code}
select e1, e2 from pm1.g2 where e1 = (with CTE1 as /*+ no_inline */ (SELECT pm1.g2.e1 from pm1.g1) select e1 from CTE1)
{code}

will pushdown as:

{code}
SELECT g_0.e1, g_0.e2 FROM g2 AS g_0 WHERE g_0.e1 = (WITH CTE1 (e1) AS (SELECT g2.e1 AS expr1 FROM g1 AS g_0) SELECT g_1.e1 FROM CTE1 AS g_1)
{code}

Note the incorrect g2.e1 reference.
