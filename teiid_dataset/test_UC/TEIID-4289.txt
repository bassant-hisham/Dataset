Add transaction command support for syntax BEGIN/ROLLBACK/COMMIT WORK
This request appears to be an expansion of TEIID-1701 to add syntax like the below as an alias for transactional commands.  This would be in line to make commands portable from other vendor DBs such as PostgreSQL/SQL Server/DB2/MySQL.

BEGIN WORK
ROLLBACK WORK
COMMIT WORK
