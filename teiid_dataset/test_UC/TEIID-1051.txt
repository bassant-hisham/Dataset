Make the Connector (type) and RAR name be the same
Currently in the Admin API in 7.0 M3

getConnectorNames() call returns the Connectors that are available in the system. These are the Teiid Connector RAR files. However, ".RAR" extension is truncated for this call. When the a Connection Factory is created, it contains the "rar-name" as the full name with the extension. They both need to be same.
