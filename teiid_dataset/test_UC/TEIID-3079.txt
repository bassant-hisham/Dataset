Security domain associated with data source is not getting deleted while deleting the data source,post server restart. 
We are migrating from Teiid 8.4 final to teiid 8.7 final.

We have custom security domain for our data sources.

We use JBoss DMR api to delete the datasource and the security domain while deleting a data source.

With Teiid 8.4 this was working fine and both the datasource and the custom security domain used to get deleted , but with teiid 8.7 it gives following exception:

 

{"JBAS014653: Composite operation failed and was rolled back. Steps that failed:" => {"Operation step-2" => "JBAS014762: Removing services has lead to unsatisfied dependencies: Service jboss.security.security-domain.edmsqlSecurityDomain was depended upon by service jboss.teiid.transport.embedded, service jboss.teiid.transport.jdbc, service jboss.teiid.transport.odbc"}}
