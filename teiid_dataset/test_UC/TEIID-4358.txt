JDG: Retain supported dependencies in the module.xml for out-of-the-box usage
In the JDG translator/connector, retain the dependencies to prior versions so that they can be integrated out-of-the-box. 

The dependencies are marked as optional, so there should be no impact until a corresponding JDG version is installed.

Include the following prior versions:
slot="jdg-6.5"
slot="jdg-6.6"
