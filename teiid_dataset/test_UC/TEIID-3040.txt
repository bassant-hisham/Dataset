MongoDB: Remove the IDREF fields for the FK fields
TEIID-2958 has been working towards removing the IDREF fields from embedded documents. I see no reason to represent FK in the parent table with IDREF either. This will make the document model representation simple and aligns with how a typical developer would design.

If the schema looks like
{code}
CREATE FOREIGN TABLE Customer (
  id integer PRIMARY KEY,
  firstName string,
  lastName string,
  email_addr string,
 FORIEGN KEY (email_addr) REFERENCES Email(address)
);

CREATE FOREIGN TABLE Email (
   address string PRIMARY KEY,
   provider string
) OPTIONS ("teiid_mongo:MERGE" 'Customer');
{code}
Currently Teiid writes the document as 

{code}
Customer
{
	"_id" : 1,
	"firstName" : "Ramesh",
	"lastName" : "Reddy",
	"email_addr" : DBRef("EMail", "abc@abc.com"),
	"EMail" : {
                 "_id": "abc@abc.com",
		"provider" : "Comcast"
	}
}
{code}

change to:

{code}
customer
{
	"_id" : 1,
	"firstName" : "Ramesh",
	"lastName" : "Reddy",
	"email_addr" :  "abc@abc.com",
	"EMail" : {
		"provider" : "Comcast"
	}
}
{code}
