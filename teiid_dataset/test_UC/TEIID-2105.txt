VDB Status issue with redeploys
I encountered this issue via Admin API.  I found that when I deployed a VDB with View DDL definition I sometimes was not able to retrieve the VDB via the Admin API getVDBs method.

Steps to reproduce:

1) Deploy VDB with a valid JDBC source.  works OK.

2) now, Add a View DDL defn to the VDB and redeploy it.  For valid View DDL that references the JDBC source defined in 1), this works fine.

However, if I submit DDL that is a valid query - but references a non-existent source group - I get the following exceptions in the log

After the above submittal of view DDL that references a non-existent source - the admin.getVDBs() call doesnt return anything.  Normally I'd get the VDBMetaData, make changes and redeploy.  But in this case, I do not get the previously deployed VDB.
