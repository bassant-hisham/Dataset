Refine option no cache behavior
Currently specifying option no cache with a particular group name cascades fully through all materialized views.  It would be better if it only applied to a single level.  Simply specifying option no cache without any specific groups would continue to behave the same way as it does currently, which bypasses cache for all materialized views.

The materialized view scripts should be changed to SELECT ... INTO ... FROM x OPTION NOCACHE x so that the loads can take advantage of intermediate materialized view layers.
