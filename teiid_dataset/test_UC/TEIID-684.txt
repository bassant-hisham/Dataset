Dynamic data integration feature (Integrate data with out a VDB)
This is feature request for dynamically integrating the data with out any modelling exercise, so that any tooling is not required before you can start integrating data. 

Using this feature, the user would create/define a Connectors (data sources) in the Teiid runtime engine, and then user connects to runtime engine using the JDBC driver provided, then he/she can start writing SQL queries that spans multiple data sources in a single statement as if they are single source. 

For example:

Data Source: A has
       TableA1
        TableA2

DataSource: B has
       TableB1
        TableB2

user can write SQL queries such as

SELECT A.TableA1.e1, A.TableA1.e2, B.TableB1.e1, B.TableB1.e2 FROM A.TableA1, B.TableB1 WHERE A.TableA1.e1 = B.TableB1.e1

They can much more complex join queries than above too.
