Add the ability to delegate one shot dependent joins to the translators
Using a memory safe iterator, like with bulk handling, we should be able to push dependent joins to the translator to perform specialized source specific one-shot join handling.

With the other dependent join improvements this should hopefully be needed only in the most extreme cases.
