Add state to request metadata
We should add state to request metadata to differentiate between queries that are long running and those that have simply been left open by the client.

Possible values:
PROCESSING
DONE (result set is complete, but the Statement is still open)
CANCELED

We could also add a new state to differentiate between requests that have been created and queued, but not yet processed.
