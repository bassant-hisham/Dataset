Due to a change in the JDBC spec on how the use of "AS" in the select statement will now be returned in the getColumnLabel of the ResultSetMetadata, Teiid must provide backwards support 
Teiid has already applied a fix to support the JDBC spec change for when an alias is used in the select clause.   The spec change says the "AS" name will now be returned when getColumnLabel() is called, instead of getColumnName().   Unfortunately, this breaks backwards compatibility.    To resolve the issue, the JDBC driver, to provide support for backwards compatibility, can allow the user to specify the useJDBC4ColumnNameAndLabelSemantics=true (default is false) property on the url (this is the recommended spec property).
