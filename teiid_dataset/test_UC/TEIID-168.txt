Refine caching behavior
Connector resultset caching should be replaced with relation and procedure caching.  This would initially be backed by the buffermanager, based upon hints/costing, and be utilized by the planner rather than the resolver.  It would be good if we also detected the level of determinism.

Query resultset caching should also be backed by the buffermanager.
