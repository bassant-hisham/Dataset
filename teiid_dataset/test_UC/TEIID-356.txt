Oracle sequence insert override change
The current behavior is to replace existing insert values if the column appears to be a sequence.  This is a hack and prevents the proper usage of an overriding insert value.  The new behavior will look for the sequence name in source only if a value is not supplied and the column is marked as auto_increment.

This is a breaking changes that needs to be highlighted in the release notes.
