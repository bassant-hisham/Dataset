Secure profile service access
As of 7.0 M3 release, the "Profile Service" access is not secure. Currently the JOPR plug-in and Teiid Admin API, force users to authenticate with "jmx-console" security domain, both these do not prevent the direct access to the "Profile Service" EJB directly. 

Profile Service can be deployed as secure EJB, such that it would require a login context to be authenticated before user has access to this bean. This needs to be configured and tested. Also document, how to configure the profile service as secure service.

Also, AdminFactory class, which provides Admin connections, need to work with secure "Profile Service".
