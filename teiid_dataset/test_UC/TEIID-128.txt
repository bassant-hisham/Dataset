Consider replacing homegrown XML-Relational doc cache implementation with JBoss Cache or other standard implementation
My understanding is that the document cache implementation in the XML-Relational connector is a homegrown implementation.  Homegrown = more code to maintain and better chance of us hitting major issues like JBEDSP-834.  Plus AFAIK this homegrown cache implementation locks the whole cache even on read operations which I suspect is going to introduce scaling problems (in fact I think we actually experienced this at a customer with 5.0SP2 but we were unable to conclusively determine that that was the cause of problems we saw then).
