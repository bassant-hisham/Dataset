Simplify configuration property metadata
In general we have too much property metadata:

required from multiplicity 0..1, 1 (no others are currently used).
hasDefault
expert
hidden
preferred
modifiable

which gives us 64 possible state combinations. 

Proposed simplifications:
1. remove the use of multiplicity and just use a required attribute.
2. remove hidden and instead use modifiable=false.
3. remove preferred and instead use expert=false (the default).

!modifiable would imply expert=true and required=false. That leaves us with only 8 states to consider based upon required/expert/hasDefault - but there's only 1 state we even care about the presence of a default value (other than for a display color). That leaves us with:

required expert outcome
t             t          1) Valid only if there is a default value, then it's an Editable property that should only be shown in expert mode
t             f          2) Editable property that should always be shown
f             t          3) Editable optional property that should be shown only in expert
f             f          4) Editable optional property that should always be shown

From a display perspective we will by default show cases 2 and 4 and then show 1 and 3 if "show expert" is selected.  Alternatively instead of show expert we could also use "show all". 

We should make provisions for old metadata to be read, such as still looking for the hidden and multiplicity attributes.
