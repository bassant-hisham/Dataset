Allow procedures to be called with end defaultable inputs
We should allow procedures to be called positionally and use default values for end parameters if they are not specified.

Condiser:

create foreign procedure proc (x integer, y string);

If you currently issue "call proc()", we'll assume named parameters and use "call proc(null, null)".

If you issue "call proc(1)", you'll get an exception.  The new behavior would be to use "call proc(1, null)".

Of course something like "call proc('a')" would still result in an exception.
