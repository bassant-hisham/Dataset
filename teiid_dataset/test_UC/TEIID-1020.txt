Remove the use of Teiid specific JDBC extensions
The JDBC extensions need to have their functionality provided by alternative means to still work in other scenarios (such as odbc).

At a minimum we should remove:
DatabaseMetaData - schemas should be available via a system procedure getXMLSchemas that returns the results as SQLXMLs.  This also fixes potential memory issues with retrieving lots of schemas.
Connection - vdbversion will probably go away and is available via the system tables
ResultSet - processing times are now local to the client, if they want to track timings then they can use a spy driver, stopwatch code, etc.
ResultSetMetaData - the vdb name is already accessible through the system tables and through the standard connection method getCatalog.  the number of parameters should be coming from parametermetadata (not yet implemented)

Statement will take some more thought.  We may want to move the xslt processing off to a system function similar to http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/infocenter/db2luw/v9r5/index.jsp?topic=/com.ibm.db2.luw.sql.ref.doc/doc/r0050650.html.  The other functionality will be hard to move as well.
