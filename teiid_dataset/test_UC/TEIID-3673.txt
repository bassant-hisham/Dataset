Subquery field with limit giving a wrong JDBC SQL in Oracle 
i'm executing the following query using Teiid 8.11.3 and Oracle translator:

select "Trx_LjM_030915"."CID" as "Trx_LjM_030915_CID"
      ,"Trx_LjM_030915"."TransactionDate" as "Trx_LjM_030915_TransactionDa"
      ,(select "Trx_LjM_030915_sub"."TransactionDate" as "Trx_LjM_030915_TransactionDa" 
        from  "AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME_MODEL"."AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME"."Trx_LjM_030915" "Trx_LjM_030915_sub" 
        where  ("Trx_LjM_030915"."CID" = "Trx_LjM_030915_sub"."CID") 
        AND ( ("Trx_LjM_030915_sub"."TransactionDate" <  "Trx_LjM_030915"."TransactionDate") )  
        order by "Trx_LjM_030915_sub"."TransactionDate" DESC 
        LIMIT 0 , 1) as "SubQuery Trx" 
from  "AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME_MODEL"."AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME"."Trx_LjM_030915" "Trx_LjM_030915" LIMIT 0 , 10   

And i'm getting this error:

Error TEIID30504 AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME_MODELVDB: 904 TEIID11008:TEIID11004 Error executing statement(s): [Prepared Values: [] SQL: SELECT c_0, c_1, c_2 FROM (SELECT g_0."CID" AS c_0, g_0."TransactionDate" AS c_1, (SELECT c_0 FROM (SELECT g_1."TransactionDate" AS c_0 FROM "AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME"."Trx_LjM_030915" g_1 WHERE g_1."CID" = g_0."CID" AND g_1."TransactionDate" < g_0."TransactionDate" ORDER BY c_0 DESC) WHERE ROWNUM <= 1) AS c_2 FROM "AUDIDATA_SCHEMANAME"."Trx_LjM_030915" g_0) WHERE ROWNUM <= 10

You can notice g_0."CID" and g_0."TransactionDate" in the where condition are no longer valid in the Teiid generated JDBC SQL; Since they do not exist in the parent query.

Note that the same case works fine with H2 and mysql
