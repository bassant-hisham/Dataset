Split all Connector projects to define their "Translator" modules and "Connection" modules
Split all the connector projects as follows

connector-jdbc --> translator-jdbc

connector-ldap --> translator-ldap/connector-ldap

connector-loopback -> translator-loopback

connector-salesforce -> translator-sf/connector-sf (more investigation on this)

connector-text -> translator-text/connector-text

connector-xml (file, http, soap) --> TBD ( these will not be jca connectors, alternative methods needs to be investigated)
