TEIID30003 - wrong order of arguments
TEIID30003 text: 
{quote}
Without required support property \{0\}, pushdown will not be enabled for \{1\} on translator \{2\}.

However, in code, it's called:
{code:java}
private static void setSupports(Object connectorID, BasicSourceCapabilities tgtCaps, Capability cap, boolean supports, Capability... required) {
    ...
    for (Capability capability : required) {
        ...
        LogManager.logWarning(LogConstants.CTX_CONNECTOR, QueryPlugin.Util.gs(QueryPlugin.Event.TEIID30003, cap, capability, connectorID));
        ...
    }
    ...
}
{code}
I.e. required capability is second ('1') attribute, not first ('0').
