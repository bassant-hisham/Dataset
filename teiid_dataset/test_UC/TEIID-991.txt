Request for support of Sybase IQ as a supported data source
Per client:
We'd like the ability to have a built-in connector type for Sybase IQ,
just the same as Sybase ASE  We have been getting inquiries and we've
had to decline one project because we didn't support Sybase IQ out of
the box.  We foresee that Sybase IQ will be getting some play within
important Data Warehouses and Data Marts within the firm.
