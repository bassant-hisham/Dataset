Add "socket" transport as service 
Add mechanism to start a socket transport as service when query engine starts. The socket transport can be used in two fold.

1) In client/server mode
2) In embedded mode (on demand). When a embedded is started then socket transport is started, then some other client can connect to it until "embedded" is alive.
