Support tighter integration with container deployments
We should be able to leverage the container:
TransactionManager/XATerminator
Work Management
Security
Connection Handling (See also TEIID-805)

and have a standard deployment model for JON discovery.  The initial plans are to deploy Teiid as a JCA rar and to allow for the creation of local (embedded) datasources from that instance, as well as allow for socket connections.
