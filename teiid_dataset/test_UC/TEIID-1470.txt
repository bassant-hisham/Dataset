Deploying VDB XML file before data sources leads to failed deployment
Using the dynamic portfolio example, the readme instructs the user to:

Copy the following files to the <jboss.home>/server/default/deploy directory.
	- portfolio-vdb.xml
	- marketdata-file-ds.xml

If the user, in fact, deploys the files in that order, and waits to see the VDB deploy before copying the data source, here's what happens.

The VDB deploys (inactive state)
The data source deploys successfully
The VDB status changes to active.

Queries will fail however as the VDB does not have access to the metadata. Had the file been copied in the reverse order, it would have all worked.

Issues at play are:
1) The readme's copying instructions are backwards, and
2) The VDB is marked as active when it should not be

Both should be corrected.
