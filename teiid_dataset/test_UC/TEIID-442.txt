Simplify configuration mechanics
The current differentiation between start up and next startup is tenuous.  After talking with Van and Ramesh a better simplified approach is to have a single live configuration, which essentially removes the notion of a startup configuration.  As configuration changes are made, TEIID-441 will do a better job of informing the admin what should be restarted.  When a host controller is asked to start processes it will save the current state of the configuration to the filesystem.  And instead of keeping a single backup, we'll keep some rotating number of them.
