Provide a single Connector, that represents the DS and Teiid Connector for JDBC sources.
Currently for dealing with relational databases Teiid requires two separate JCA components. 

1. Data source 
2. Teiid Connection Factory to the Data Source above

Teiid query engine talks to 2, which in turn talks to 1. In this scenario, 2 provides the query translation facilities + acts as the proxy connection for the 1. Complications arise, as 2 is  exposed as managed connection as well as 1. To be transactionally correct the both managed connections must behave like one. Also, there is burden on the user to create two separate "-ds.xml" files to define a single Teiid Connector.

Since for 2, JCA behaviour is not needed, this can be removed. 

Provide a way to define a single "-ds.xml" file that will create a data source as well as the connection factory. Make the connection factory a stateful connection, which holds on to the data source connection.  Provide templates to create such CF + DS in single step.
