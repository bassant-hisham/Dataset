Refine client control of query plans
The OPTION clause settings DEBUG, SHOWPLAN and PLANONLY should be replaced with the following set statements:

SET SHOWPLAN ON|DEBUG|OFF
SET NOEXEC ON|OFF - general purpose way to turn off execution

The plan will still be available off of the TeiidStatement JDBC extension.
