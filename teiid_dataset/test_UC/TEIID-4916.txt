Ensure modules have only a single or compatible licenses
Code that is EPL, MPL, and LGPL should be isolated from code that is ASL.

For the index metadata logic it probably makes sense to dual or re-license the ASL code under EPL.  The remaining MPL (saxon / xom related) logic and LGPL (odata wkt) should be separated as their own modules.
