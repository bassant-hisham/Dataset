Order By and Limit are not getting pushed to the database, when Union and join are used together. 
Order By and Limit are not getting pushed to the database, when Union and join are used together. 
In this scenario there if the underlying table has millions of records the query never returns with data.

*Query 1*: Using only Join without union, this works fine.
