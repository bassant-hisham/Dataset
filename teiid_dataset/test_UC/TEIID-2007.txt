JDBC warnings are not properly handled
Adding warnings individually results in redundant exceptions.  See also TEIID-1829

This is a behavior change though since the resulting warnings on the client side will be held by the cause.  Proper access would be:

//warning will be an instanceof TeiidSQLWarning to convey model/source information
SQLWarning warning = stmt.getWarnings();

while (warning != null) {
  Exception e = warning.getCause();
  if (cause instanceof SQLWarning) {
    //childWarning should now be the head of the source warning chain
    SQLWarning childWarning = (SQLWarning)cause;
    while (childWarning != null) {
      //do something with childWarning
      childWarning = childWarning.getNextWarning();
    }
  }
  warning = warning.getNextWarning();
}
