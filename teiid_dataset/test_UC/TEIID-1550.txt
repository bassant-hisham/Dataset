Row level security enhancements
To assist with implementing row level security through UDFs the following enhancements are requested:

1. Add the ability for data roles to cover functions.
2. Add the ability to get the JAAS subject from the CommandContext so that UDFs can perform attribute or other checks on the subject easily.

Actual row level security will then be up to the implementer of the UDF.
