Accumulo does not return null values
Accumulo doesn't return null values when a whole 'column' is being selected.
For a command in accumulo shell like:
{code:plain}
scan -c name:BYTENUM
{code}
Accumulo returns only non-empty values, this is expected behaviour.

Equivalent query in Teiid would be:
{code:sql}
SELECT ByteNum FROM SmallA
{code}
Which returns the same results as Accumulo does. That means, no NULL values, if there are rowids without specified column families/qualifiers missing. But when a user has his schema defined in a vdb, he probably expects, that he will get as many rows as there are in the table.
