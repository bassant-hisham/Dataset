Change Admin API, to support the Translation Layer and Connection layer concepts.
Now that we have two separate layers to define a connector the Admin API must be modified to aid in managing the lifecycle of the Translation Layer and Connection Layer. Some obvious methods will be

- addTranslator(name, properties)
- deleteTranslator(name)

will keep the current data source methods for the connection. The previous names with "Connection Factory" will be removed/renamed.
