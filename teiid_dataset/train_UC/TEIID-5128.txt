transaction support value not cloned on access node
The transaction support flag is not cloned, which leads non-transactional access to still start a transaction.  For example with typical web services lateral join when preformed in a procedure:

begin
select ... from (invokeHttp...) as x, texttable(...);
end

Since the procedure plan is cloned for invocation, the transaction support flag won't be set.
