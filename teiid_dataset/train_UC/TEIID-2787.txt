Correlated grouping expression not properly replaced in pushdown subquery
A correlated grouping expression appears in the pushdown query with the internal group name anon_grpX rather than the proper reference from the outer query.

For example the user query:

select x, (select avg\(y) from tbl1 where x = tbl2.x) from tbl2 group by x

would have

where x = anon_grp0.x
