Dynamic VDB deployment fails when using importer.importIndexes in the case of a index containing a hidden column
We are trying to use dynamic VDB. For better performance, we use <property name="importer.importIndexes" value="true"/> to input the index for an oracle datasource.

 

But vdb deployment failed with following error:

     [TEIID60011 No column found with name SYS_NC00032$]

 

Debugging through teiid code, it looks like that if the index contains the hidden column (like SYS_NC00032), then index loading failed, teiid was trying to call getColumnByName() for those hidden column which does not exist in the column map.
