Problem with Import VDB with Materialized View (external)
Having defined a VDB which contains a Model that has External Materialization, when importing this VDB into another that also uses External Materialization, Teiid Server is searching in the wrong place for the view status.

Example:

..
<import-vdb name="CountryServiceListVDB" version="1" import-data-policies="true"/>
...
<model name="MyView" type="VIRTUAL">
...
				SELECT cns,
					country_code
				FROM NumberingPlan.numbering_plan;
....
		</metadata>
	</model>

*NumberingPlan.numbering_plan is defined in the imported VDB, and is also Materialized.*
