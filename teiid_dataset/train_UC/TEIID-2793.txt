Searchablity check is too broad
The check against searchabilty metadata gathers all column references in an expression, rather than checking just the expression itself.  This was done probably to prevent comparisons such as convert(clob_col, string) = 'foo' - but this is inconsistent as we will happily push the same convert function in the select clause.
