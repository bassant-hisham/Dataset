Impala Time/Date/Timestamp handling
Impala supports only TIMESTAMP datatype (see here http://www.cloudera.com/content/cloudera-content/cloudera-docs/CDH5/latest/Impala/Installing-and-Using-Impala/ciiu_porting.html) 

Converted everything into timestamp and now I am trying to get Date and Time parts of the timestamp in Teiid e.g.

SELECT DISTINCT convert(Source.SmallA.TimeValue, time) as TimeValue FROM Source.SmallA ORDER BY TimeValue

But I get TranslatorException: Unexpected exception while translating results: Method not supported


Tried to workaround this but with limited success. For Date it is possible to use to_date function that returns string reprsentation of the date part. For Time I wasn't able to find the solution (have not yet figured out how to use extract function through Teiid).
