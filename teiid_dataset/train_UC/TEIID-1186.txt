The following XML in the reference guide (reformatted here for clarity) references an unknown id, "other_commands".  

When building in jDocBook this produces a non-functional link in PDF, and a link the containing page in the html output.

<para>
Previous versions of Teiid accepted the PLANONLY, DEBUG, and SHOWPLAN option arguments.  
These are no longer accepted in the OPTION clause.  Please see the 
<link linkend="other_commands">other commands</link> chapter for using these options.

Where should this be pointing to ?
