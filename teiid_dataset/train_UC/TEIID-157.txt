mmadmin - Add a short start-up help text for users
After watching John Verhaeg struggle with his initial use of mmadmin, it seems a short paragraph shouuld be displayed when mmadmin is executed. This could explain how to get help, basic usage, etc.

Also, if JAVA_HOME and/or SERVER_CLIENT aren't defined, is it possible for the startup to request this info, rather than asking the user to edit mmadmin?

We'd like this tool to live on, but it needs to be more user friendly.

PS: At no time did we actually enjoy laughing at John while he struggled, but it was kinda humorous. Seriously. Honest.
