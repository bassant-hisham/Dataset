ORDER BY DESC is ignored in STRING_AGG function when DISTINCT is also specified
When both DISTINCT and ORDER BY clause are specified in a STRING_AGG function, the result of the aggregate function is not correctly sorted.

For example, running the following query:
{code:sql}
select 
	string_agg(col1, ',' ORDER BY col1 DESC) as orderByDesc, 
	string_agg(col1, ',' ORDER BY col1 ASC) as orderByAsc, 
	string_agg(DISTINCT col1, ',' ORDER BY col1 DESC) as distinctOrderByDesc, 
	string_agg(DISTINCT col1, ',' ORDER BY col1 ASC) as distinctOrderByAsc 
from (
	SELECT 'b' as col1
	UNION ALL
	SELECT 'c' as col1
	UNION ALL
	SELECT 'a' as col1
        UNION ALL
	SELECT 'c' as col1
) x
{code}

the result is:
||orderByDesc||orderByAsc||distinctOrderByDesc||distinctOrderByAsc||
|c,c,b,a|a,b,c,c|a,b,c|a,b,c|
