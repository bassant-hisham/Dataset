Google spreadsheet translator issues
The GoogleJSONParser has handling for javascript dates, but only of the form new Date(...)

However the data result uses datetime/date values that are actually string literals of the form

"Date(...)"

Also the time format is an array of numbers:

[1,2,3,4]

The translator needs to account for all of these.

Additionally:

- support for ClientLogin should be removed as it is no longer allowed by google. 
- there is a collision between resource bundles as they are in the same package between the connector and api modules.
