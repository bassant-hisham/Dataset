Expose buffermanager monitoring properties
We should expose:

BufferServiceImpl.getUserBufferSpace - the number of megs currently used by the buffermanager disk storage.

A rough total of the memory buffer space used can be added, which would be from the BufferFrontedCacheStore concurrent bits set X block size.

Also the BufferManagerImpl could report the total estimate of objects held in memory.
