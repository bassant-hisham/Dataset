Support function SUBSTRING_INDEX in MySQL5ExecutionFactory
It is currently difficult to achieve the same functionality that is offered by *SUBSTRING_INDEX * function without direct support from _MySQL5ExecutionFactory_.

So it would be nice to have this function implemented in the execution factory.
