JDG translator has disabled capabilities for GT and LT
Operations GT and LT are not pushed down to JDG. Indexes are enabled for all columns. Operations GE and LE are pushed down correctly.

Example:
The first query is pushed down correctly. The second query doesn't push the "greater than" operator to the source.

Query:
{code}select  intkey from smalla where intNum >= 5 order by intkey{code}

PROCESSOR PLAN:
{code}
AccessNode(0) output=[c.intKey AS IntKey] SELECT g_0.intKey FROM SmallAs.smallARemotecache AS g_0 WHERE g_0.intNum >= 5 ORDER BY g_0.intKey
{code}


Query:
{code}select  intkey from smalla where intNum > 5 order by intkey{code}

Plan:
{code}
SortNode(0) output=[c.intKey AS IntKey] [SORT] [IntKey]
  ProjectNode(1) output=[c.intKey AS IntKey] [c.intKey AS IntKey]
    SelectNode(2) output=[c.intKey] c.intNum > 5
      AccessNode(3) output=[c.intNum, c.intKey] SELECT g_0.intNum, g_0.intKey FROM SmallAs.smallARemotecache AS g_0
