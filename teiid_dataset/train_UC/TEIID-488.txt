XML Plugin reporting/bundling the incorrect entries
1. Changed all "ConnectorTypeClassPath" properties to be hidden
2. Changed all "connector-*.6.0.0" references to be "connector-*-6.0.0 (notice the first dot now is a dash)
3. Removed "Default Value=..." for all "ConnectorClassPath" properties

I believe we had talked about 1 & 3. Barry had told me about the JAR name changes.

I noticed following JARs are not in your "extensions" directory yet are referenced by multiple "ConnectorTypeClassPath" property values:

1. axis-jaxrpc-1.3.jar (this used to be in extensions dir)
2. wsdl4j-1.5.1.jar (this used to be in extensions dir)
3. xml-apis-1.0.b2.jar

Can references to these be removed from the configuration.xml file?
