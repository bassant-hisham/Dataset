Clarify source warnings
When a warning is added through an ExecutionContext, the client receives the exception wrapped by a SourceException, then wrapped as a SQLException.  The issues with this are that the SourceException class is not expressly public and there is an unnecessary level of wrapping.

We should introduce a TeiddSQLWarning for non-partial results warnings that would contain source/model information and prevent the unnecessary wrapping.
