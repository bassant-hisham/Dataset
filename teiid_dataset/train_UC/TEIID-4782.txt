Change framework to catch RutineException from translator/connector
Discussion:

Generally the connector/engine logic should be responsible for handling whatever exception is thrown.  For example ConnectorWorkItem and DataTeirTupleSource do intercept RuntimeExceptions, but rethrows them.  We may want to instead convert them into Processing exceptions as the ConnectorWorkItem level.
