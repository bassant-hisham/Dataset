adminApi getSchema does not include namespace info in the DDL
I was following this community example
https://community.jboss.org/wiki/MicrosoftExcelDocumentIntoRelationalTable

The DDL returned for the deployed dynamic vdb is attached.  However, the DDL does not include a namespace statement like this 

SET NAMESPACE 'http://www.teiid.org/translator/excel/2014' AS teiid_excel
