Embedded usage issues
Now that the deploy.properties contains security information, the connection properties should not be allowed to override its values in the embedded usage scenario.  Also our usage of process name does not truly allow for multiple processes to be used with the same install.  For now, we should remove the code that attempt to differentiate the logs based upon the process name and let this issue serve as KI that embedded usage should only be for dedicated scenarios.  If multiple classloaders or vms need to share the same install, then server mode should be used.
