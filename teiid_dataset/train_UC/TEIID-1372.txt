Change the default Teiid user from "admin" to something else
Currently Teiid default user is "admin" with password "teiid", also the Admin Console's default user name is "admin" with password "admin". This is a confusion point with users in differentiating the Admin user from default Teiid user. Should consider changing the default user to something else.
