Misleading error message when using quotation marks: Parse error... encountered (
Using AdminShell, I entered a query: select "foo" as expected;. The result I received was:
// Error: Parser Error: Parse error at line 2, column 8.  Encountered: (

There was no ( in the query.  The error message is misleading, especially in the case where there is a left parenthesis.

Correcting the quotation marks to apostrophes produces correct results.
