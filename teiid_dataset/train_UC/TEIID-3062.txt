Apply LIMIT 1 optimization for DISTINCT in UNION situations
The translator does not support select expressions.  Query:
SELECT  DISTINCT  DATAMART_NAME AS c_9, '_constant_' AS c_10 FROM (SELECT datamart_name FROM
  (
      SELECT 'DATACOM Datamart' AS DATAMART_NAME FROM SECURITY_DM_DATACOM_DEV_R140_CA31_CMGRD1.VIEWOBJACCESS
      UNION ALL
     SELECT 'DB2 D91A Datamart' AS DATAMART_NAME FROM SECURITY_DM_DB2_D91APTIB_CMGRD1.VIEWOBJACCESS
  ) AS t
) a

OPTIMIZATION COMPLETE:
PROCESSOR PLAN:
SortNode(0) output=[datamart_name AS c_9, '_constant_' AS c_10] [DUP_REMOVE]
  ProjectNode(1) output=[datamart_name AS c_9, '_constant_' AS c_10] [datamart_name AS c_9, '_constant_' AS c_10]
    UnionAllNode(2) output=[datamart_name]
      AccessNode(3) output=['DATACOM Datamart' AS DATAMART_NAME] SELECT 'DATACOM Datamart' FROM SECURITY_DM_DATACOM_DEV_R140_CA31_CMGRD1.VIEWOBJACCESS AS g_0
      AccessNode(4) output=['DB2 D91A Datamart' AS DATAMART_NAME] SELECT 'DB2 D91A Datamart' FROM SECURITY_DM_DB2_D91APTIB_CMGRD1.VIEWOBJACCESS AS g_0

Expected LIMIT 1 in the access nodes.  Comment from Steven:  "More than likely we are not checking across a union for this optimization."
