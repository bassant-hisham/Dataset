Change Teradata defaults for dependent joins
Teradata does not suggest hard limits on in predicates, but uses the wording:

"Queries that contain thousands of arguments within an IN or NOT IN clause sometimes fail."

It has been reported that the defaults of 50 in predicates with 1000 values each will cause such a failure.
