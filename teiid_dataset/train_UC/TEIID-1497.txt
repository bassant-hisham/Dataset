misc subquery enhancements
Federated exists and scalar subqueries should be implicitly limited to not pull back extra results.

The subquery aware evaluator should have a small cache to reuse correlated results.

uncorrelated subqueryin and some forms of quantified comparison should be processed as dependent set criteria or use an indexed structure for teiid evaluation.
