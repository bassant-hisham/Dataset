Teiid Designer Integration Tasks
Changes needed:

1. Move DQPEmbeddedProperties to the client
2. Add an extension mechanism to modify DQP services without directly depending upon embedded.
3. Directory handling issues: the mm.io.tmpdir setting is ignored, cache and transaction store directories may be relative to launch location and should be based upon properties/tmp location.
