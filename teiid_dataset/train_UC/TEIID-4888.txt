Support for SetQueryLimit
OpenEdge RDBMS not support fetch/offset in a set query. For example, the generated SQL:
SELECT 
g_1.ejer AS c_0
FROM PUB.modpre AS g_1 
UNION ALL 
SELECT 
g_0.ejer AS c_0 
FROM PUB.modesp AS g_0 
FETCH NEXT 100 ROWS ONLY

For the view:
CREATE VIEW Modificaciones(
    ejercicio     INTEGER
)AS SELECT T.ejercicio
FROM(
    SELECT M.ejercicio,
FROM sipbas.modesp AS M
UNION ALL
    SELECT M.ejercicio
FROM sipbas.modpre AS M) AS T;

It is necessary to be able to indicate SetQueryLimit in the same way as with SetQueryOrderBy.
