Ordered limit against preserved view fails
With a view that has a column name that does not match the output name such as:

create foreign table x (a string, b string, c integer, primary key (a, b)) options (updatable true); create view SvcView (RowId integer PRIMARY KEY, code string, name string) as select c as rowid, a, b from x limit 2;

A query that orders over the rowid:

select rowid, code, name from svcview order by rowid limit 1

Will fail with an assertion error initializing the top level sort node.
