Develope a JPA Translator
Provide a JPA based translator in Teiid. The main driving force for this is to support Hibernate OGM, which in turn uses big data stores like infinispan, EhCache as backing stores. Hibernate OGM also looking to expanding to other stores like Cassendra, MongoDB etc.

By providing JPA translator (think reverse hibernate), which provides
- Metadata
- Query API (JPQL)

which makes much easier for Teiid to identify data in big data stores and gives ways to integrate with other kinds of sources, both relational and non-relational. This usecase is limited to users who has defined their data using JPA and would like to use big data stores. Additional benefit of this is to provides full Relational access to a JPA store with JDBC/ODBC and SQL.

if the data in big data store is not in JPA objects, then see https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-1992
