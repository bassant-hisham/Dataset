Do not throw exception when ending transaction with TMFAIL
From customer case 289126. When Metamatrix participates in global transaction, if XAResource.end is called with TMFAIL, the transaction is set to be roll-back only and an XAException is thrown to indicate the changes. However, weblogic transaction manager does not expect the exception.
