AdminShell deployVDB method prepends the path to server's deploy directory to VDB location 
Calling deployVDB thusly:
deployVDB( "/home/pnittel/temp/TestInstallerArtifacts/install_options/performance_overlay/profile/deploy/TPCRperf_70.vdb" )

causes this error:
java.io.FileNotFoundException: /home/pnittel/temp/TestInstallerArtifacts/test_server/jboss-5.1.0.GA/server/default/deploy/home/pnittel/temp/TestInstallerArtifacts/install_options/performance_overlay/profile/deploy/TPCRperf_70.vdb (No such file or directory)

What happens is AdminSHell prepends to my file path string, the path to the deploy folder where the VDB will be deployed. It should not do that.
