XML Formatting error in Dynamic VDB (.def) file presents to user as file not found
I created paul.def which contained a connector to Oracle. When I tried to query anything (for example, "SELECT 1;"), I received an error that indicated the paul.def file was not found. After patching Teiid to produce a better message, we found I had fat-fingered the XML in the .def.

Would have saved a bunch o' time had the correct error message been shown in the beginning.
