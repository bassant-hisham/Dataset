assignDataSource issues
The assignDataSource admin operation has several issues
- it uses different logic to create translator instances (which means that it cannot newly create delegating transaltors)
- it adds new ConnectorManagers to the repository before they are valid (may have the wrong ExecutionFactory)
- if the datasource is changes, the translator will stay same regardless of if it is being changed
