adding possibility to proxy URI in odata server
As for https://community.jboss.org/thread/237239 there is the need to proxy the URI exposed by the odata server when this is behind a proxy and we do not want the URi to disclose and invalidate the reference.

The odata server should have some parameters gotten from deployment for proxy hostname and port and path up to the VDB name
