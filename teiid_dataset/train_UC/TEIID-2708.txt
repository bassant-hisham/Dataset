DataRolePolicyDecider configuration
In the conversion over to AS 7 the bean properties for DataRolePolicyDecider were not added to the configuration.  More than likely this was because the bean itself is pluggable.

We either need to add these properties to the configuration or add an alternative mechanism for setting them (system and/or vdb properties would probably be just fine).
