Local connection waits for active VDB 1,000,000 times longer than specified in waitForLoad property
If user specifies waitForLoad connection property in URL, Teiid waits for longer time than specified in the property.

I believe it is because you call Object.wait(long) method with wrong parameter \[1\]. In combination with TEIID-4388, from users point of view, local connection waits for active VDB for ever.

\[1\] See this [commit|https://github.com/teiid/teiid/commit/d7e161ff04c77f8f2da85b2debb1b1d81916d551#diff-6b75c0b6472a3a96e8722226ca97b376R218]. You call method like _vdb.wait(timeOutNanos);_, but from javadoc: *timeout - the maximum time to wait in milliseconds.* It means that Teiid waits 1,000,000 times longer than specified in parameter.
