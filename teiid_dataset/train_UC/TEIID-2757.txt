XML 1.0 invalid characters not supported in Odata Atom feed
The odata framework sometimes has problems with transforming characters (invalid in XML 1.0) from the source data to the XML result. The result is an exception: TEIID16013 Error occured producing OData result.: java.lang.RuntimeException: com.ctc.wstx.exc.WstxIOException: Invalid white space character (0x1b) in text to output (in xml 1.1, could output as a character entity).
