HIVE2:  got Invalid table alias or column reference when running UNION ALL query on HIVE2
If I tried to combine 2 tables from a same HIVE2 data source using UNION ALL, I got "Invalid table alias or column reference" error.

Query that I submitted to Teiid originally:

select "name"
from (Select * from hive2.opportunities_small UNION ALL Select * from
hive2.opportunities) "query"
group by "name"
order by "name"

Query that Teiid generated:

SELECT v_0.c_0 FROM (SELECT c_0 FROM (SELECT g_1.name AS c_0 FROM
opportunities_small g_1 UNION ALL SELECT g_0.name AS c_0 FROM opportunities
g_0) X__) v_0 GROUP BY v_0.c_0 ORDER BY v_0.c_0

Error:

Invalid table alias or column reference 'v_0': (possible column names are: c_0)
