Temp table ordering not honored with index
If an IN predicate against an index is not entered in ascending order and an order by is specified against the same index, then the result will not be ordered properly.

For example:

create local temporary table x (e1 string, e2 integer, primary key (e2))
...
select * from x as y where e2 in (3, 2) order by e2
