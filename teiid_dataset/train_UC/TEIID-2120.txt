BatchIterator can prematurely terminate
If a save on mark batchiterator reads through a batch in a mark state it will not be saved to the buffer and then not be available for re-reading.

This specifically affects the right side of already sorted non-full outer merge joins with match regions that are sufficiently large to span batches and the full mark batches are not read on the first pass.
