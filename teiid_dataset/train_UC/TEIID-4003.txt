Vertica and DB2 translators use incorrect push down of WEEK function
TEIID-3282 changed the semantics of the WEEK function to use the iso behaviour.

The Vertica database has WEEK_ISO function that returns the iso week, but the translator does not have that alias set.

This results in the query (the datevalue in question is 2000-12-31)
{code:sql}
select week(datevalue) from source.largea where intkey = 365
{code} 
to return 54, when the correct value is 52.
