Temporary table bounded index search may miss values
Temporary table indexes (which are also used for internal materialized view indexes) may not return results for bounded searches (which would either be partially specified keys - either a query against a non-unique index or against a compound key, but with only leading columns) will fail to find the appropriate value if the values falls on an intermediate higher level page upper edge.
