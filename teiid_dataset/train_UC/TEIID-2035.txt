DeleteDataSource method on Admin API does not completely delete the Connection Factory
ConnectionFactory requires a two step creation process

1) create the resource-adaptor section
2) connection factory section

The delete is removing the (2) and not (1). Thus any subsequent creates using the same name fails.
