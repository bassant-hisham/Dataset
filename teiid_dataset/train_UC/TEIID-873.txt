Add support for quoted identifier aliases
The sql spec allows for creating quoted identifier aliases (containing spaces, the period delimiter, etc.).  We should support this style of alias for maximum portability.

The issue with allowing this is that the internals of revolving and metadata do not account for the delimiter character in a table or column name.
