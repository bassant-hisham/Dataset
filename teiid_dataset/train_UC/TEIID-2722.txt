Cassandra:  ORDER BY should do it in memory instead of trying to push down Cassandra in some cases
When I tried to join 2 tables together from same keyspace using Teiid 8.6 Alpha with Cassandra 1.2.11.   It broke down SQL into 2 CQLs.  However, teiid SQL transformer adds order by clause to the CQL which is not supported.

Original SQL:

select "cassandraDS_users"."user_id" as "cassandraDS_users_user_id",
"cassandraDS_invoice"."sale" as "cassandraDS_invoice_sale"
from "cassandraDS"."invoice" "cassandraDS_invoice"
inner join "cassandraDS"."users" "cassandraDS_users" on ("cassandraDS_invoice"."user_id" = "cassandraDS_users"."user_id")

Break Down CQL:

SELECT cassandraDS.invoice.user_id, cassandraDS.invoice.sale FROM cassandraDS.i
nvoice ORDER BY cassandraDS.invoice.user_id

SELECT cassandraDS.users.user_id FROM cassandraDS.users ORDER BY cassandraDS.us
ers.user_id

Error from CQL Driver:

com.datastax.driver.core.exceptions.InvalidQueryException: ORDER BY is only supported when the partition key is restricted by an EQ or an IN.
