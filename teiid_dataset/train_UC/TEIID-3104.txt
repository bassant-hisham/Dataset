ArrayImpl toString not correct
The arrayimpl tostring is not correct for multi-dimensional arrays and does not follow the convention of appending a trailing comma for arrays of less than 2 elements.  Typically this tostring is not seen as there is the Array expression class, but source sql can contain ArrayImpl values.
