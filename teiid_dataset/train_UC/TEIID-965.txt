Need Excel file importer / connector
Really need to add an Excel connector in SP1.  The easiest way to do this is probably with one of the open source JDBC drivers that work over Excel files.  

Something like:
https://xlsql.dev.java.net/ - Excel JDBC driver (GPL unfortunately, so we probably can't distribute the driver)
http://www.andykhan.com/jexcelapi/ - Java Excel API (GPL too)
http://xlsjdbc.sourceforge.net/ - LGPL (uses Apache POI), really cheesy and maybe not being updated
http://jakarta.apache.org/poi/ - Excel API, event-based and not particularly friendly
