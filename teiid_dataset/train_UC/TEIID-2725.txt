Group by doesn't work with MongoDB
Group by SQL with/ without aggregate function returns incorrect values:

For example:

Original SQL:

select "grade", sum("score") as "sum_score" from "mongoDBDS"."grades" group by "grade" order by "grade"

 

Transform query:

SELECT grades.grade AS c_0, SUM(grades.score) AS c_1 FROM grades GROUP BY grades.grade ORDER BY c_0

$group:{ "_id" : "$grade" , "c_1" : { "$sum" : "$score"}}

$project:{ "c_0" : "$grade" , "c_1" : 1}

$sort:{ "c_0" : 1}

Expected Result:
grade   score
A	187
F	55

Actual Result:  (INCORRECT)
grade	score
	242

It only returns SUM(score) and group by fields are ignore.
