Move WebServices Resource to System Properties
Defect Tracker #19774: See attachment regarding changes.

The properties are misleading and leads to confusion by everyone.

This has been assigned for 4.4, instead of now, because of the moving of properties and it would be better suited to a major version and a migration was required.  Therefore, no additional work just to handle the properties would be needed.
