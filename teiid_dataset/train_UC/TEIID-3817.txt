HANA FLOOR and CELING functions not applicable to boolean
SAP HANA doesn't support FLOOR and CEILING functions for BOOLEAN type.
Compared to postgresql, which also has BOOLEAN data type, it seems inconsistent.
When querying postgres directly:
{code:sql}
SELECT CEILING(BooleanValue) FROM BQT1.SmallA
{code}
is not valid query.
But through Teiid, it returns double values corresponding to the boolean value provided:
0.0 for CEILING(false)
1.0 for CELING(true)
