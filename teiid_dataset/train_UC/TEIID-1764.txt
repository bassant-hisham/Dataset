Hibernate Month Date Extraction
When using teiid-hibernate-dialect-7.1.1.GA, the TeiidDialect does not include a function to get the month value of a date object. It includes functions to get other date attributes (year, dayofmonth etc). Without a defined function, attempting to get a month value falls back on the hibernate-core function which attempts to utilize an extract method which is not supported in 7.1.1. 

Example Query: select d from Data d where month(d.date)='09'

Being able to obtain a month value from a date is a critical requirement.
