Combine the setting of tmp, cache, buffer, and txn store locations.
We should just define the root work directory for all of the temporary information.  That will make integration and cleanup a lot easier.

The deploy.properties would for example use

dqp.workdir=./work

then cache, etc. would be located at

./work/<instance>/cache etc.
