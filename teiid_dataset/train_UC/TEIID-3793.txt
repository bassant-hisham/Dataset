Push Teiid function LOCATE() to SQL Server
We have some Teiid views with query similar to:
SELECT col1
FROM tableA
WHERE SUBSTRING(col1, 1, LOCATE(' ', col1)) = 'PREFIX'

SQL Server receives a full scan of col1 table without WHERE:
SELECT col1
FROM tableA

Because Teiid LOCATE() function is not translated to CHARINDEX() SQL Server function (SUBSTRING is translated).
