postgresql extract used for date functions returns double, not integer
Postgresql extract returns a double precision (which is documented as the expectation), but we expect integer values from the respective Teiid functions.  This typically won't lead to an issue in a simple projection scenario, but is problematic for combined expressions, such as using mod which will result in an exception.
