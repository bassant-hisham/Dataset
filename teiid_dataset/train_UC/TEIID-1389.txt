Add additional detection for conflicting criteria to help optimize query plan
Add additional detection for conflicting criteria such as "(column1=1 OR column1=2) AND column1=3".  The attempted use case was a case of a UNION that was using the column as a measure of selecting a specific datasource, with each query joined by the UNION having a specific set of column1 values (such as "column1=1 OR column1=2").  In the case of the end user application submitting criteria such as "column1=3", the query planner should prune any branches of the UNION with a conflicting set of values for column1.  It would also be helpful if other operators such as <, >, <>, IN, etc. could be accounted for.
