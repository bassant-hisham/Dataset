Impala - Select * fails with reserved words in query
Impala translator can handle reserved words in queries by quoting but doing select * the query fails in an unhelpful way.  Example:
--succeeds
select calendar_type,
       start_date,
       calendar_year,
       quarter_structure, 
       date_key, 
       'month', 
       week, 
       day_of_month 
  from warehouse.dim_advertiser_calendar;

fails due to reserved word "month" as a column in the virtual table:
select *  from warehouse.dim_advertiser_calendar;
