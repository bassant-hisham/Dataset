MongoDB:  failed to translate to mongo query with boolean value expression
Fail to translate the following SQL to mongo query:

select "grade",
"name",
"score",
"state",
"grade" as "test",
("name" = "state") as "name2"
from "mongoDBDS"."grades"
where "grade" = 'B'

However, it works with the query contains group by and boolean value expression:

elect "grade" as "test",
"grade",
("name" = "state") as "name2",
sum("score") as "sum_score"
from "mongoDBDS"."grades"
where "grade" = 'B'
group by "grade", "grade", ("name" = "state")
order by "grade", "test", "name2"
