Error returned from SQL Server: Incorrect syntax near: NULLS
Running the TPCR queries has worked previously, I believe even with Teiid from a short while back. Now it's not. This particular query is detailed below.

Transformation text:
SELECT 
		S_NAME, COUNT(*) AS numwait 
FROM 
		TPCR.SUPPLIER, TPCR.LINEITEM AS l1, TPCR.ORDERS, TPCR.NATION 
WHERE 
		(S_SUPPKEY = L_SUPPKEY) AND (O_ORDERKEY = L_ORDERKEY) AND (O_ORDERSTATUS = 'F') AND (L_RECEIPTDATE > L_COMMITDATE) AND (EXISTS (SELECT 
						* 
FROM 
						TPCR.LINEITEM AS l2 
WHERE 
						(l2.L_ORDERKEY = l1.L_ORDERKEY) AND (l2.L_SUPPKEY <> l1.L_SUPPKEY))) AND (NOT (EXISTS (SELECT 
							* 
FROM 
							TPCR.LINEITEM AS l3 
WHERE 
							(l3.L_ORDERKEY = l1.L_ORDERKEY) AND (l3.L_SUPPKEY <> l1.L_SUPPKEY) AND (l3.L_RECEIPTDATE > l3.L_COMMITDATE)))) AND (S_NATIONKEY = N_NATIONKEY) AND (N_NAME = 'SAUDI ARABIA') 
GROUP BY S_NAME

Query I executed:
select * from vTpcr.Q21 ORDER BY numwait desc, s_name LIMIT 100;

Error I received:

This failed both in the Designer (running the version from 8/31) and Teiid (9/1, running as a server). I'll attach the server log and project to this defect.
