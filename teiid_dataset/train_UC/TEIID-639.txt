DQP Identity issues
Currently we key off of a system property to determine dqp identity.  This does not work in environments that load multiple instances of teiid in the same vm - it's also cumbersome even with multiple vms sharing the same deployment location.

We should determine a unique value for the user based upon the instances in use.
