Recursion Limit not being processed for XML documents - Possible recursion issue?
I ran the E2ERecursiveXmlTextSource test. It involves setting a limit of 3 on the recursion, and then changing the limit to 4 (where all XML document queries will pass). I found the limit exception was being thrown regardless of the setting (even up to 10).

I changed the behavior from THROW to RECORD and now the queries do not return (in a timely manner), leading me to worry that recursion may be the cause, not the limit itself.

Model Project Set and server log will be attached.

Just looked at the command log and it looks pretty weird. I'd be inclined to start there. I AM able to successfully query the source (text).
