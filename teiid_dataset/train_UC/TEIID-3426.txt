Salesforce importer does not set cardinalities
The salesforce importer does not set cardinalities for salesforce objects it imports. That is causing problems with joins involving more than two tables, and when there are no criteria on a large table. If the large table is joined later, it retrieves all the rows of that table and joins them with the result of the previous joins.
