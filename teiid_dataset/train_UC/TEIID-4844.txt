Google translator unexpected behavior for comparison with time
Comparison operators <, <=, >, >=, =, <> work unexpectedly for 'time' datatype, foreign table has column 'timevalue time OPTIONS (NATIVE_TYPE 'TIMEOFDAY')'.
I created view with column 'TimeValue time', inserted data in format '10:57:23'.
I run queries like 'DELETE FROM smalla WHERE TimeValue < {t '10:57:23'}'
* <, <>, <= deletes all rows, including rows that should be left
* >, >=, = deletes no rows
