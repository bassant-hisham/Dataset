Extension metadata is not visible when queried through OData
x`Hi,
I used Teiid Designer and just plain XML editor (because Teiid Designer would constantly complain) I created Model Extension Definition file which I was able to successfully register. My definition was showing up in Model Extension Registry view. I deployed my virtual database and tried accessing columns and tables via Odata:
http://localhost:8080/odata/MCR_VDB/Tables?$format=json
http://localhost:8080/odata/MCR_VDB/Columns?$format=json

Both documents returned did not contain any extra metadata I defined.
HELP!

Thanks.
Alex
