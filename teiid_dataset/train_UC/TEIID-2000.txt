Provide install script for Teiid to be installed in the domain mode
Currently the teiid domain mode configuration is defined in the domain-teiid.xml and some of the deployments of RAR file in a script file, to complete the install.

Also, JBoss AS defines a many varieties for "profiles" for the domain mode as well as the standalone mode. If use would like to install any other profile, they need to go though manual modifications. 

The solution here is to provide a CLI script that installs Teiid subsystem and configures it.
