Calling getRequests() on RuntimeEngineDeployer Results in MethodNotFound 
Executing a call to getRequests() of the RuntimeEngineDeployer from the Teiid Jopr plugin results in a MethodNotFound exception. I know the method exists though and I can see (in debug) that it is being executed. Also in debug I can see an error in org.jboss.profileservice.management.KernelBusRuntimeComponentDispatcher java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Class is not a simple type: org.teiid.adminapi.Request$State. I believe this to be a clue as to the real issue here. I have no stack trace, just what I was able to ascertain from debugging.
