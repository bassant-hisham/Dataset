Common table expressions are not pre-evaluated
With sql such as:
{code}
    with test as (  
          select CURDATE() as startDate  
            from schema.table)  
    select startDate from test  
{code}

The curdate function will be pushed to the source regardless of whether it is supported.  It should be pre-evaluated prior to pushdown.
