Allow local connections to use thread bound transactions
To facilitate usage of non-pooled local connections, it would be useful for the engine to automatically use the thread bound transaction for queries.

An approximate workaround in local mode is to set the userSourceQueryConcurrency to 1 and use the disableLocalTxn property if needed to prevent calling code from starting a local transaction.  The downside of this approach is that non-transactional work will be performed serially and Teiid temporary tables will not be transactionally aware.
