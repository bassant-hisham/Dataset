VM and Queue statistics should represent the new pool stats
The workerpool changes were never fully propagated to the console/adminapi.  We need to remove the notion of ephemeral stats (enqueued/dequeued/highwatermark), and instead expose more of the over all stats current/highest thread/queue and total submitted/completed.

This also affects the queueworkerpool adminapi object.
