BQT Pushdown query "ORDER BY" is not always ordering results properly
Pushdown queries with "ORDER BY" are not always returning results in correct order. The below query is returning query results in the wrong order for Pushdown on DB2, MySql, Ora9-10-11, and SqlServer sources.  If BQT1.SmallA.StringKey is placed in the SELECT clause the results are returned in the correct order.

SELECT BQT1.SmallA.IntNum, BQT2.SmallB.StringNum FROM BQT1.SmallA, BQT2.SmallB WHERE BQT1.SmallA.IntNum = BQT2.SmallB.StringNum AND BQT1.SmallA.IntKey >= 5 AND BQT2.SmallB.IntKey >= 5 ORDER BY BQT1.SmallA.StringKey
