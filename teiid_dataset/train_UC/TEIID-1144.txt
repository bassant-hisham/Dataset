PostgreSQL (simple capabilities) returning an unexpected number of rows
Several BQT queries are failing in PostgreSQL (simple capabilities) with an unexpected number of rows returned.  
An example query can be seen below.  This query is expecting 50 rows returned since there are 50 rows in smalla table but 
only 44 rows are returned.

SELECT * FROM BQT1.SmallA AS A WHERE EXISTS (SELECT INTKEY FROM BQT1.SmallA AS B WHERE B.INTKEY = A.INTKEY)

vdb is attached.
