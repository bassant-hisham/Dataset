OData 4 array type handling
To ensure we are appropriate returning the correct error messages, creating the right upstream changes, etc. we have several paths to validate wrt array handling.  There are:

In the translator - ODataProcedureExecution.getQueryParameters, ODataFilterVisitor.visit(Function) and ODataFilterVisitor.visit(ColumnReference), ODataExpressionToSQLVisitor.visitAlias, ODataUpdateVisitor.visit(Update)

In the OData service - ODataExpressionToSQLVisitor.visit(Alias)

From the spec it appears that a uri should be able to specify arrays, but olingo and other frameworks may have limitations.  For example it should be possible to have an array argument to a function, but the olingo framework will complain that arrays are not allowed in the resource part of the uri.  

At the very least we'll capture what won't work with this issue.
