Set Query Timeout on the Server 
Hi,

We want the configuration of the Query Timeout set on the server side instead of setting it for the Statement Object.
Please see this discussion for more information http://community.jboss.org/message/600599#600599
We want the setQueryTimeout to override the default values.
