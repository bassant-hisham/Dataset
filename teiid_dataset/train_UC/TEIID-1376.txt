Add support for pushing joins through a union
Given a query structure such as:

inner join
   union all
     a
     b
   union all
     c
     d

where a,b,c,d are access nodes to a source that supports joins and there is a constant column projected by each union branch and that column is used in the join predicates, then we should be able examine

union all
  inner join
    a
    c
  inner join
    a
    d
...

to determine if any of the joins will no longer be necessary. 

This is a possible pattern in a multi-source or partitioning scenario.  

In some scenarios there may not be an actual projected literal, which could be accommodated if a foreign key could be marked as partitioned.
