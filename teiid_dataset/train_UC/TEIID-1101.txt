Teiid Example PortfolioDS specifies a username & password for Derby source where none is required
The instructions for creating the Derby database used by the portfolio example do not specify creation and use of a username/schema. The portfolio-ds.xml file does, however, specify a username and password. When the user attempts to use this data source, it fails since there is no such schema as "sa".

We shold either direct the user to create the schema and user account, or--much simpler--eliminate th use of the username/password from the data source file.

On the other hand, my idea of "simple" might not be the right way to go ;-)
