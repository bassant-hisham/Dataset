dependency and validation logic incorrect
With TEIID-3042 validation of triggers was added, but does not properly account for the parsing/resolving - however it is only being run in the case where there are no columns defined on the view and they are instead inferred from the definition.

Similarly dependencies are only being determined on view with no columns defined.
