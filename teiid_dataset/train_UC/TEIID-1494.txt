Allow the optional join hint to work with non-ansi joins
The optional join hint currently works only in ansi joins, and then only if the table(s) are not used in where predicates forcing unnatural on clauses.

e.g. select b.* from /\*+optional\*/ a, b where a.x = b.x

should still allow a to be optional.
