HIVE:  quote is removed for TIMESTAMP field in where clause
I am running teiid 8.6 against HIVE.  And I found out that quote was removed for TIMESTAMP field in where clause.  And it caused java.sql.SQLException: Error while processing statement: FAILED:  ParseException line 1:88 missing EOF

Original SQL:

select "the_date", 
"store_sales"
from "hive2"."sales_seq"
where ("the_date" > '1970-05-16 00:10:04')

Teiid generated SQL:

SELECT g_0.the_date, g_0.store_sales FROM sales_seq g_0 WHERE g_0.the_date > 1970-05-16 00:10:04.0

Exception:

Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: Error while processing statement: FAILED:
ParseException line 1:88 missing EOF at '00' near '16'
