Replace translate criteria
While we hardened the usage in 7.2, translate criteria has too many implied restrictions to reliably perform the update/delete the user query is specifying.

It would be better to rely on better default handling (especially pass-through) TEIID-1349 and to remove the current restrictions on virtual update, such as requiring scalar set clause values and no subquery evaluation TEIID-1267.  

This change should not remove the possibility of using TRANSLATE CRITERIA/CREATE PROCEDURE, as it will not be removed until Teiid 8 or later.  

Beyond the default handling, one possible construct is to provide the user with an cursor that contains the update (or delete) set with the corresponding updated values.  Then leave it up to the user to iterate over the change set and process the changes.  One drawback with this approach is that it may be hard to decipher from the view output rows how to apply the updates to constituent tables when the view transformation is a set or join and branch descriminators or additional primary keys are not projected.  Of course those situations were already difficult to handle with translate criteria.   

This will require coordinated designer changes.
