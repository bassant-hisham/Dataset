Add headers parameter to invokeHttp
There is a need to set common headers, such as content type and accepts.  Since there may be other custom values it probably makes sense to do this as a generic parameter as Ramesh suggests:

    call restBDM.invokeHttp(action => 'POST', endpoint =>  qp, headers=>'ContentType=application/json;Accepts=application/text')
