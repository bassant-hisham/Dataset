Wrong aliasing when "supportsSelectExpression" is false in translator capabilities
When "supportsSelectExpression" is false, in the translator capabilities and user submits a query like 

{code}
select sum (intnum) as "sum" from smalla group by intkey order by "sum"
{code}

the pushdown command at the translator is
{code}
SELECT SUM(SMALLA.INTNUM) FROM SMALLA GROUP BY SMALLA.INTKEY ORDER BY c_0
{code}

The alias in the ORDER BY is wrong. Also do not understand why the query engine pushed the aggregate is being pushed, possibly due to "supportsAggregatesSum" is turned on.
