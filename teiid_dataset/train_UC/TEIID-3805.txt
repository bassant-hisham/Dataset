HANA SUBSTRING function inconsistent with teiid behaviour
When querying HANA using hana translator, there is an inconsistency in handling SUBSTRING with similar parameters:
{code:sql}
SELECT SUBSTRING('sth',20,1) FROM tablename
{code}
That is, when the starting offset supplied to SUBSTRING function is greater than the length of the string value, Teiid returns NULL in this case. 
But when I run:
{code:sql}
SELECT SUBSTRING(STRINGNUM,20,1) FROM bqt1.smalla
{code}
(it is pushed to HANA and STRINGNUM column contains strings of length <=2)
I get empty strings instead of NULL values, which is default in Teiid.

This inconsistency is caused by different handling of such situation on HANA's side.
