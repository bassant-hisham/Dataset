Google translator unexpected behavior for view update without trigger
If there is a view (CRUD.SmallA_Direct) which defines only a subset of foreign table (Source.SmallA) columns, there needs to be defined a trigger for update to work correctly. Otherwise unexpected results are returned after executing update:
* for updated rows, it converts String columns of SmallA_Direct to decimal numbers, 
* for not updated rows it returns null for String columns
