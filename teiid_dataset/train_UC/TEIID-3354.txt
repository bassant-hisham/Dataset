AdminConsole fails getting mat view info with data roles
Once data roles are enable the web console fails to get the mat view info - unless the user allows access to systemadmin for the admin user.

I'm logging this initially against the Teiid side as depending on the resolution we may want to change the admin code (for example using a SYS.table).
