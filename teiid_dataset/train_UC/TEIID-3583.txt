Need documentation on possible property settings to use
In the Administration and Configuration Guide there is some indication on how to perform active heap throttling. 
"Memory Management Considerations " there is a reference to parameters like: 
 max-processing-kb and the max-reserve-kb. 

Anyway there is no indication of the indicative values to associate to those parameters to obtain a certain result. 

It would be good to get some examples to understand the cause and effect of the changes ( max-reserve-kb and related settings ).
