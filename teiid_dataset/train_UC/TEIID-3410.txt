OData object URI does not resolve to a usable URL.
OData object URI does not resolve to a usable URL. When accessing a VDB via odata with a browser either via JSON or XML the uri listed in the metadata is not valid, it doesn't have the FQN of the table, only the type shows FQN:

"__metadata" : {
"uri" : "http://localhost:8080/odata/ODataRHQ/rhq_agent(10001)",
 "type" : "RHQ32.rhq_agent"
