MultiArrayOutputStream computes count incorrectly
The count computed may not be correct when the bytes written exceeds the primary array size.  This impacts teiid in client to server messaging when the client message exceeds 1 < 15 bytes - which is uncommon, but can happen with extremely large sql, large directly bound (not stream) values, etc.

The exception produced will be shown as "Connection reset".  The server will log the exception as an EOFException - but at a detail level since we assume that IOExceptions can be logged at a lower level.
