Couchbase - query with comparison criteria not properly translated
Issuing simple query with comparison criteria like \[1\] returns empty result. From what I can see, the query is not properly translated - it is translated to query with syntax error \[2\].

Another issue here which I can see is that Teiid does not provide any information to the user that query actually failed. Only empty result is returned. This one, I will report it as a separate issue.
