DDL Option properties not namespaced for salesforce
The Option keys for DDL with saleforce source are not getting namespaced.  This is inconsistent with other sources like excel.  See attached file - comparison of two tables - Excel source vs Salesforce source.  The excel keys are prefixed with a namespace teiid_excel:  but the salesforce keys are not.
