Teiid Designer uses 0 as a default length value
If you create a view in teiid designer, but define it with an expression:

select case when rand() < .5 then 'heads' else 'tails' end as x

A string column length will be set to 0.  On the server this may cause issues such as with the odata layer that will check facets against the length of 0.
