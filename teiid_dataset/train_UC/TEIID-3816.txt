Informix translator - <> ALL is translated as NOT IN - this statement seem to not work in Infromix
Query:
{code:sql}
SELECT INTKEY, BOOLEANVALUE FROM BQT1.SMALLA WHERE BOOLEANVALUE <> ALL (SELECT BOOLEANVALUE FROM BQT1.SMALLA WHERE INTKEY = 40)
{code}
Source-specific command:
{code:sql}
SELECT g_0.IntKey, g_0.BooleanValue FROM Source.SmallA AS g_0 WHERE g_0.BooleanValue NOT IN (SELECT g_1.BooleanValue FROM Source.SmallA AS g_1 WHERE g_1.IntKey = 40)
{code}

*Note: boolean value for row where Intkey = 40 is false.*

Expected result:
|intkey|booleanvalue|
|1|true|
|...|...|

Actual result:
|intkey|booleanvalue|
|0|false|
|...|...|

This seems to be an Informix issue as neither '<> ALL' nor 'NOT IN' works.
