Issues with EventDistributor
Non remote methods called twice in clustered mode and with the EventListener methods (add/remove listener).  The proxy will call the local and the remoting handling, which again will call the local.

Also the Embedded logic is not properly initializing the eventdistributor as it is starting before the objectreplicator may have been created.
