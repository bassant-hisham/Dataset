Resolving an aliased view prevents inherent update from working
If an aliased form of an inherently updatable view is resolved first, we will cache invalid update info which prevents inherent insert/update from functioning correctly.

For example with the view gx, first running:

select * from gx as x
        
will prevent an inherent insert such as:

insert into gx (e1, e2, e3, e4) select * from pm1.g1

from working as expected
