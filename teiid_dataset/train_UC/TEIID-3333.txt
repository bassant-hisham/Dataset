Dynamic VDB deployment - JDBCMetadataProcessor NPE
I am getting NPE in JDBCMetadataProcessor for the attached dynamic VDB deployment in teiid 8.7 (DV61).  This VDB uses the DashboardDS H2 source that comes installed with DV61.

The NPE happens with this specific import property
<property name="importer.TableNamePattern" value="DASHB_A%"/>

The table name pattern is valid - there is a table named DASHB_ALLOWED_PANEL.

If you change the pattern to DASHB_D%, the deployment is successful.
