If a column is blank the TEXTAGG function excludes it from the output 
If a column value is blank,  it is excluding it in the result, causing incorrect output. 

TEXTAGG(FOR Last_Name, 
		           First_Name, 
                           Middle_initial,
			  Currency_Code  
                          DELIMITER '|' QUOTE '"' 
                  )

 In the above example,   if middle name is blank,  then it should still show one empty column with "|" delimiter as shown below.

Steigner|Debbie||USD

But it returns output as excluding middle name since it is blank.

Steigner|Debbie|USD
