execute immediate only checks immediate parent scope
A procedure such as:

{code}
begin
  create local temporary table t1 (e1 string);
  loop on (select 1 as a union all select 2) as c
  begin
    execute immediate 'select c.a' as e1 string into t1;
  end
 select * from t1;
end
{code}

should return two rows, but instead returns nothing because the execute immediate statement doesn't see the surrounding t1 temp table.
