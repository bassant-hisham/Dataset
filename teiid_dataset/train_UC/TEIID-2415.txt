Ensure thread-safety of mutable metadata
Some metadata values can be changed at runtime, such as transformations, stats, and properties.  In the case of transformations and stats an exception won't occur, but the most up-to-date value may not be read by other threads.  Changing the properties could cause an exception as the map changes are not concurrency safe - similar to TEIID-2342
