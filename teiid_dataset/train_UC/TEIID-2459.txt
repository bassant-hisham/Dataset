WITH statement translated wrongly for Oracle 10 
I am using Oracle 10g [1] and I have set the Oracle version to 9.2 in a dynamic VDB [2].

I am running simple WITH statement against Oracle: WITH x AS (select DATEVALUE from SMALLA) select DATEVALUE from x. Which throws [3]. Probably because Oracle 10 doesn't support column aliasing "WITH x (DATEVALUE)".
