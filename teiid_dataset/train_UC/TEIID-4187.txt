Extend support for PI OLEDB Enterprise Queries in OSI PI Translator
Background - PI OLEDB queries go against the PI Data Archive whereas PI OLEDB Enterprise go against PI AF, which is a metadata layer that sits atop the PI Data Archive. Both sets of queries are now accessible from the PI JDBC adapter. 

Please add the following enhancements to allow the OSI PI translator to work more effectively with OLEDB Enterprise queries.

1) Import table valued functions as Teiid procedures
2) Allow the pushdown of nested table joins
3) Update the PI translator to use the CROSS APPLY syntax.
4) When importing schemas, importer.ImportKeys has to be set to false as otherwise we receive a DuplicateRecord exception since the table value function ft_GetPIPoint appears in more than one place in the AF schemas. Could we please put in a fix/workaround to address this?

Please refer to the OLEDB Enterprise Guide for query syntax and rules for more detail.
