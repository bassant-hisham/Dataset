issues with embedded
The dependency set for the ws translator is incomplete the cxf bundle jar and several other dependencies are needed.  

We are not including the JBoss modules jar, but have an implied dependency through EmbeddedProfile, which should be refactored so that the modules jar is not needed in the embedded kit.

Also the classpaths in the example scripts are incorrect with the 8.7 refactoring to put optional dependencies in subfolders.
