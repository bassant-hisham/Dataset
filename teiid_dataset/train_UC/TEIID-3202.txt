Add the translator to the log entry when the model is loaded
When the server starts up and there's a log entry for the model when its loaded.  Example:

11:00:29,691 INFO  [org.teiid.RUNTIME] (MSC service thread 1-2) TEIID50029 VDB QT_Hive_Push.1 model "Source" metadata is currently being loaded. Start Time: 9/25/14 11:00 AM

It would be nice to have the associated translator that was assigned at load time.    This can be helpful to tracking down issues.
