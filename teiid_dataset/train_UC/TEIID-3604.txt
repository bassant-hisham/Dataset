jsontoxml produces wrong result with nested multi-dimensional arrays
A json doc with a multi-dimensional array below the root level will have its elements flattened rather than nested in the xml.  For example:

{foo : [[1,2],[3,4]]}

is producing 1,2,3,4 as siblings rather than nested as:

<foo>
   <foo>1</foo>
   <foo>2</foo>
</foo>
<foo>
   <foo>3</foo>
   <foo>4</foo>
</foo>
