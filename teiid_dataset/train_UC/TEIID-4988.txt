Oracle - table alias is not used in whole query
When I run query like \[1\] Teiid translates it to query which does not use one of table aliases in whole query. Oracle (11g 11.2.0.2.0) seems to be sensitive to aliasing table and then not using it. Query fails. Source specific query (problematic one) \[2\].

Sample query which fails if running directly against Oracle database \[3\]
