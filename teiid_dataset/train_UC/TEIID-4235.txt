dynamic sql recursion check not valid after caught exception
With a procedure like:

begin
  execute immediate
exception e
  ...
execute immediate ...

An exception on the second execute immediate will be seen like:

org.teiid.api.exception.query.QueryProcessingException: TEIID30168 Couldn't execute the dynamic SQL command "EXECUTE IMMEDIATE ..." due to: TEIID30347 There is a recursive invocation of group 'proc'. Please correct the SQL.

Even when the dynamic sql does not re-invoke the proc.  The issue is that when catching the initial exception thrown doesn't clear the entry from the recursion stack.
