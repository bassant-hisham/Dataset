SQLTranslators are held per connection, but are inited for each execution
This is problematic for several reasons.  One the runtimemetadata is expected by the sqltranslator, but that is an execution level context - multiple models from different vdbs may be assigned to the same connector.  Also the initialize method is still called, which incurs the cost rebuilding the modifiers.
