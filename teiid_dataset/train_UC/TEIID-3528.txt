Solr translator - batched update with more than one query gets stack
PreparedStatement.executeBatch() with more than one query gets stack (but data are stored in Solr). For more details see server.log.
However batch of size 1 and Statement.executeBatch() run without problems.
The issue is not present in 6.1.1 version.
