Combining multiple 'in' criteria can prevent pushing criteria to database
When two 'in' criteria containing constant values on the same field are combined with an 'or', Teiid will combine the two into a single 'in' operation.

Since Oracle (for example)  has a 1000 item limit on the 'in' values, if the resulting combined list contains more than 1000 values, it can no longer be pushed down into Oracle for execution.
