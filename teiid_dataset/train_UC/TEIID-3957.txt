Impala translator - Add pushdown of offset in LIMIT clause to overcome difference in LIMIT clause
With the impala translator we issue this LIMIT to Teiid:
ORDER BY somecolumn DESC LIMIT 75, 25
this means give me 25 rows starting from *ROW* 76.

In Impala's SQL this should be translated to:
ORDER BY somecolumn DESC LIMIT 25 OFFSET 75
BUT this means give me 25 rows starting from *PAGE * 76 (with page size of 25 rows)

The Teiid Impala translator doesn't push the offset but sums the limit and offset:
ORDER BY somecolumn DESC LIMIT 100

Request we add pushdown, which will be more efficient and overcome the difference in how offsets are handled between Impala and Teiid.
