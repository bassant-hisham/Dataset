Incorrect work of left join statement
the following query:
{code:sql}
SELECT a.email, b.email, lower(a.email), lower(b.email) FROM test_tables.test_emails as a left join views.test_view_emails as b on lower(a.email)=lower(b.email)
{code}
leads to the following results:
 !test_emails_bug1.jpg|thumbnail! 

though running the same query on PostgreSQL leads to the following results:
 !test_emails_pg.jpg|thumbnail! 
so this query mentioned above must work as on PostgreSQL putting null values for the b field table where conditions can't be performed.
