Infinispan Hotrod Translator UPDATE on primary key column
UPDATE query where the PRIMARY KEY of the table is being changed succeeds, returns update count of corresponding rows, but the changes don't get promoted to actual cache.

Consider
{code:sql|title=UPDATE query}
UPDATE SmallA SET StringKey = 100 WHERE IntKey > 25
{code}
where StringKey is set as PRIMARY KEY and 6 rows fulfill the filter on IntKey>25.

When this UPDATE is performed, returned number of rows update is 6, but the contents of the cache don't change.

There are several applicable resolutions:
# There should be error thrown by Teiid, that this is not allowed operation
# There should be update count 0 returned
# There should be change in JDG cache, effectively squashing the 6 rows into single one
# There should be error thrown by Teiid, that there is duplicate PK value (this is not something Teiid usually enforces)
