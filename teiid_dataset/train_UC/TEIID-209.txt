SalesForce Connector should support semi-join and anti-join pushdown upon release of 14.0 API
SalesForce API 14.0 is adding support for semi-joins and anti-joins, e.g.:

 SELECT Id, Name 
 FROM Account 
 WHERE Id IN 
(SELECT AccountId FROM Opportunity WHERE StageName = 'Closed Lost')

Supporting pushdown in these situations could improve query performance dramatically in some cases. 

It appears that the API puts a number of odd restrictions on the use of these "joins", which may make the implementation difficult.

See http://www.salesforce.com/us/developer/docs/api/index.htm for details (search the index for SOQL select).
