Using adminapi, importing VDB subsequent times causes a an exception that says the VDB already exist in the extensions
A VDB cannot be imported more than once because subsequent imports causes an exception that says the VDB already exist in the extensions.   There are 2 problems here:

1.  The actual exception, SQL Exception - invalid sql, wasn't seen
2.  The sql being used was missing a ending quote.
