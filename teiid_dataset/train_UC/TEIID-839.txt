adminAPI shutdown method gets NPE and does not shut down the server
How to reproduce:

1 - Start Teiid Server
2 - Start AdminShell
3 - connectAsAdmin to the running server
4 - shutdown(1000);

AdminShell disconnects, but the server remains up. (You can reconnect via AdminShell.) As I was getting the log to paste the NPE here, the server burped out a couple of MB of junk. Now I'll attach the logs.
