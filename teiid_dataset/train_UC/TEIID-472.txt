Teiid Embedded unable to login to JDBC data sources requiring username/password
I took the PartsSupplier_VDB from the Designer and tried to use it in Teiid Embedded. Using a simple JDBC query tool, I was unable to login to the data sources (Oracle and SQL Server). Working with Ramesh, we found we could edit the configuration.def inside the VDB and edit the mm-encrypted password to plain text and it would work. As an alternative, we could use the configuration.xml file from the Designer and that worked.

Ramesh will fill in the technical details...
