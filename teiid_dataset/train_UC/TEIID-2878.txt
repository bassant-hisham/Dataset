Push ORDER/LIMIT for UNION query
Better support for queries on unions between different sources. ORDER BY is necessary on the inner queries because otherwise the result set will be truncated too early. ORDER BY can be hardcoded on the inner queries but this limits flexibility. Currently in 8.6 if LIMIT is not hardcoded on inner queries, ORDER BY will be stripped from query.
