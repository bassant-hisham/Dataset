Import properties definitions provided via getTranslatorDefinitions() call do not return default values
While enabling runtime-provided *IMPORT* properties for the Teiid Connection importer in Designer, I noticed that the property definitions that got returned did not include a *defaultValue*.

The feature will work as is, however, users may be needlessly setting some properties to default (like most booleans) to false.

This is also inconsistent with the Translator Override property definitions. The majority of those are defined with default values.
