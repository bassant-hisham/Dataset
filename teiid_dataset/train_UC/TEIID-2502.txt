Oracle Struct Serialization Error
I'm issuing a query (a simple select * from table) on a VDB's table that contains a geometric column from oracle spatial.
I'm getting the following error in SquirrelSQL

Error: org.teiid.net.socket.SingleInstanceCommunicationException
SQLState:  08S01
ErrorCode: 0

Afterwards the connection is broken and I cannot access any other table and have to reconnect since I get:
Error: Error Code:TEIID20013 Message:Error Code:TEIID20013 Message:java.net.SocketException: Socket closed
SQLState:  TEIID20013
ErrorCode: 0

I'm trying to access a SDO table and a geometry type column, but hoped that TEIID could read it as a BLOB without caring about the real type.
Probably it doesn't like it too much.
