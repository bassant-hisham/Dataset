Bypass lookup function's keycolumn reserved word
When using the Teiid LOOKUP function, the 3rd argument is to specify the keycolumn.  In my table, the column I want to reference is literally named "value", which is a SQL reserved word.  The generated query chokes on this because it's not expecting a reserved word to be here when parsing the grammar.  I've tried quoting and escaping to get around this, but nothing seems to work.
