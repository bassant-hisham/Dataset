Kerberos/SPNEGO Module Dependency Missing
I encountered an issue where the LoginModule class was not found when trying to use the Kerberos and the SPNEGO Login Module


A workaround was proposed to add the following to the to the org.jboss.teiid module.xml dependency list. 

<module name="sun.jdk"/> <!-- Kerberos -->
<module name="org.jboss.security.negotiation"/> <!-- SPNEGO -->
