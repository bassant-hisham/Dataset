Incorrect source query with simple inherent updates
A delete query against a view fails, when in WHERE clause there is a filter on non-directly mapped column. Please note, that the integer type is only example, this happens for any type (time/date/timestamp amongst other).
{code}
          CREATE FOREIGN TABLE SmallA (
               IntValue string,
               StringKey string PRIMARY KEY
               ) OPTIONS(UPDATABLE true);
           CREATE VIEW VSmallA(
               IntValue integer,
               StringKey string PRIMARY KEY
           ) OPTIONS (UPDATABLE true) AS
           SELECT
               CONVERT(source.IntValue,integer), source.StringKey FROM Source.SmallA as source;
{code}

And following queries:
{code:sql|title=DELETE query}
DELETE FROM VSmallA WHERE IntValue=13
UPDATE VSmallA Set StringKey='a' WHERE IntValue=13
{code}

I get an incorrect source query with x.intvalue in the predicate.
