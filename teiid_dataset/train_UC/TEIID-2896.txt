Add TEXTTABLE function capabilities to interpret fixed width data file content that is shorter than the defined line length
Current behavior is that data lines too short to fit a fixed width data interpretation produces an error such as "Error: Text parse error: Fixed width line width 35 is smaller than the expected 60 on text line 1 in file:/tmp/file.csv.". The customer's use case is interpreting data files from another application which bundles multiple types of data along with additional descriptive info/metadata about the data contained within the file. As the error is thrown if any lines after the first interpreted line are shorter than the summed value of the fixed width columns, they are unable to query the file. The customer wishes for the ERROR to be suppressed and the query to return the data independent of whether it fits the fixed width criteria and potentially to be able to filter the data being retrieved.
