HANA translator : incorrect pushdown of DAYOFWEEK function
Teiid's DAYOFWEEK function:
{code:plain}
DAYOFWEEK(x) 	Return day of week (Sunday=1, Saturday=7) 
{code}
is pushed down as:
{code:plain}
dayname(g_0."DATEVALUE")
{code}
but this function returns string representation of the day.

More appropriate would be to push DAYOFWEEK as WEEKDAY function, but the returned value has to be adapted to Teiid's representation (Sunday=1 and Saturday=7, vs. HANA's Monday=0,Sunday=6). So the solution would be to push:
{code:sql}
MOD((WEEKDAY(datevalue)+1),7)+1
{code}
