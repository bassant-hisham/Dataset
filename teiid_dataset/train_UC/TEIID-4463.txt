No results with cross source outer join and offset only
TEIID-3568 introduced a regression where when only an offset is used, the pushed limit will effectively prevent any results.

So a query like:

select ... sourcea.tbl left outer join sourceb.tbl ... offset 1 row

will push a limit 1 to the sourcea.tbl query, effectively eliminating all results.
