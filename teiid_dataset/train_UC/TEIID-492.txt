Reference evaluation should not rely on exact reference instances
Reference cloning currently returns the reference itself and all associated evaluation code relies upon setting values directly on these references.  It would be far better - and allow for follow on features (plan caches that aren't restricted to a single session) - to have references be properly clonable and have evaluation based upon dynamic value contexts.
