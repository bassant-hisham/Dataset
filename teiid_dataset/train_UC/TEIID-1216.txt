Cannot pass xml result from one select as critera to another select
I've created a VDB with procedures to create and parse XML, as wall as one to invoke the WS connector.  SQL that unites them all into a single call passing the created XML into the invoke procedure is failing:

SELECT t.* FROM table (EXEC cis.CountryInfoServiceXML.CapitalCity.create_CapitalCity('US')) AS request, table (EXEC CountryInfoService.invoke('SOAP11', '', request.xml_out, 'http://www.oorsprong.org/websamples.countryinfo/CountryInfoService.wso')) AS response, table (EXEC cis.CountryInfoServiceXML.CapitalCity.extract_CapitalCityResponse(RESPONSE.result)) AS t;
