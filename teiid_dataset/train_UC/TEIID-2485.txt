Remove the resteasy patch thats no longer needed in EAP 6.1 ER5
The resteasy patch thats provided in the kit is no longer needed.  As of EAP 6.1 ER5,  resteasy has been upgraded to 2.3.6, and resolves RESTEASY-812 issue. 

I have verified the fix and have several EAP 6.1 ER5 servers running with Teiid 8.4 alpha without the patch applied.
