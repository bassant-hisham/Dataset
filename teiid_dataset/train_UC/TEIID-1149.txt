Importing tables from a deployed VDB does not import columns
I created, and deployed, a VDB containing source and view models. I am able to query these tables.

I created a new project and into that project I attempted to import a view model's table from the previously-created VDB. What I found in the imported was the models and tables were shown, but no columns were available for import. Once imported, the tables did have no columns.

Screenshot and other stuff attached.
