Couchbase strange behaviour for long numbers
There is a strange limitation for storing large numbers (e.g. modelled as long) in Couchbase.

The same behaviour with value: 28341791043587382
which is being stored and retreived as: 28341791043587384

I feel we need to document this behaviour and provide hints how to overcome it. (Modelling of the column as string on Couchbase's side and defining a view).
