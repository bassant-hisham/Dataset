More aggressively use enhanced join sorted index to prevent buffering 
In some circumstances the cost of buffering the unsorted side to determine the applicability of the index is greater than simply using the index.  The logic should also use a better estimate of the memory footprint of the index - which is only required to hold the depth of tree in memory at one time.
