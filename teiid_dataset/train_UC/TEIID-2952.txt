Crypto exception with client/server running on different java versions
The DiffieHellman key generation logic varies by platform with the handling of leading 0's in the secret.  1.6 seems to strip while most 1.7 vms do not.  A related Java bug is http://bugs.java.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=8014618  which indicates Sun/OpenJDK JRE 7u17 - 8b94 are affected.

If there is conflicting handling between the client/server then approximately 1 out of 256 connection attempts will fail with a bad padding exception, since the client/server will be operating against different symmetric keys.
