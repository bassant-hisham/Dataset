Allow LOBs to be accessable after the statement close in the local connection scenarios
When a LOB returned the resultset, the contents of it are only accessed when resultset/statement and/or connection object is not closed, so that internal resources can be appropriately cleaned up. 

This can be relaxed in the local connection scenarios, as the data access is occurring in the same VM, by taking advantage of single read nature of SQL/XML to cleanup once the resource is read or closed.
