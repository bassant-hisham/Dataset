HANA translator: incorrect pushdown of week function
Hana translator pushes down function week to SAP HANA datasource as its WEEK function. But it is not in accordance with the ISO8601 rule.

For this standard, HANA has function ISOWEEK, which returns results in following format:
{code:plain}
2000-W01 for date 'Jan 3, 2000'
{code}
So it should be possible to push Teiid's WEEK function as:
{code:sql}
SUBSTR_REGEXPR('[[:digit:]]{4}\-W([[:digit:]]{2})' IN ISOWEEK(datevalue) GROUP 1)
{code}
where 'datevalue' is column of DATE datatype.
