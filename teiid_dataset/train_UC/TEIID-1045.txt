Provide a admin method to "export" a Data Source.
As of 7.0 M3, there is no admin method to export a data source that is defined inside the AS. This needs to be supported for the tooling purposes.

Also, the "addDataSource" only supports to create XA data sources. It should also allow to create "local" data sources.
