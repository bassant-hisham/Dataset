Optimization places correlated subquery in the on clause, which is not supported by DB2
Reproducible behavior with the following simplified query [1] 
Avoiding the error by including non-restricting criteria on tables not represented in the WHERE EXISTS clause [2].

ie:  there seems to be a problem in the Optimization that writing the query similar to [2] will avoid.
