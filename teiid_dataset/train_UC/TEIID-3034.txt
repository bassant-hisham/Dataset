Add support for OData query parameters
There are some OData v2 query parameters that don't appear to work as of Teiid 8.7 (please see teiid forum thread 241566 on this topic). I believe these are all OData v2 conventions.

?$inlineCount=allpages&$top=N   :  always returns count = $top

$expand   : does not appear to work (but no ostensible error)

$count  :  "TEIID30088 Unrelated order by column g0.SYSID cannot be used in a SET query, with SELECT DISTINCT, or GROUP BY"  occurs using this URI pattern entity/$count  , per the OData documentation for using this parameter
