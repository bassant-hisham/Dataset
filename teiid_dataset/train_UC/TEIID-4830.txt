Parsing Error when deploying VDB with "geometry" as column name
The following query works correctly if run against a deployed VDB:
{code:sql}
SELECT 'a' as "geometry";
{code}

However, the following VDB fails to deploy:
{code:xml}
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<vdb name="test-vdb" version="1">

    <model name="Test" type="VIRTUAL">
        <metadata type="DDL"><![CDATA[
            CREATE VIEW test(c1 string) AS
            SELECT 'a' as "geometry";
            
        ]]></metadata>
    </model>
</vdb>
{code}

with the error
{noformat}
TEIID31080 Test.test validation error: TEIID31100 Parsing error: Encountered "SELECT 'a' AS [*]geometry[*]" at line 1, column 15.
Was expecting: id
{noformat}

This seems to only happen when the name is "geometry", I could not find any other reserved word that would cause the same error.
