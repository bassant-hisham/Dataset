Equality comparison of JoinPredicate returns true even when JoinPredicate criteria is different
When comparing the following command objects the commands evaluate as equal when performing c1.equals(c2) even though the criteria is different in the two commands:

c1 = SELECT bqt1.smalla.intkey, bqt1.smallb.intkey, bqt1.smalla.intnum, bqt1.smallb.intnum FROM bqt1.smalla LEFT OUTER JOIN bqt1.smallb ON bqt1.smalla.intkey = bqt1.smallb.intkey AND bqt1.smallb.intnum = 1

c2 = SELECT bqt1.smalla.intkey, bqt1.smallb.intkey, bqt1.smalla.intnum, bqt1.smallb.intnum FROM bqt1.smalla LEFT OUTER JOIN bqt1.smallb ON bqt1.smalla.intkey = bqt1.smallb.intkey


This is due to the method com.metamatrix.query.sql.lang.JoinPredicate.equals(Object obj) referencing itself when getting the criteria from itself and the obj being passed in:

...
List thisCrit = this.getJoinCriteria();
...
List otherCrit = this.getJoinCriteria();
...
