External Materialization Management Issues
Couple issues 

1) Based on https://docs.jboss.org/author/display/TEIID/External+Materialization document, the property teiid_rel:MATVIEW_STAGE_TABLE needs to be optional, however it is been coded as required.

2) If an exception occurs during the loadMatview, the status table is set to "FailedLoad" however the exception is not logged to know the source of the issue. This needs to logged.
