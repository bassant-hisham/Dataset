window functions in view return incorrect results
conditions and limits above a view are too broadly allowed to be pushed through a view layer containing window functions.

From the forum posting for example:

{code}
SELECT
        "StateProvinceID"
        , COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY a."CountryRegionCode") AS num
    FROM salestaxrate a
    WHERE "TaxType" = 3{code}

returns the correct counts, where as 

{code}
SELECT *
FROM
(
    SELECT
        "StateProvinceID"
        , COUNT(*) OVER (PARTITION BY a."CountryRegionCode") AS num
    FROM salestaxrate a
    WHERE "TaxType" = 3
) x
WHERE "StateProvinceID" = 45
{code}

returns counts where the state province id condition is applied before the windowing.

The currently logic will only prevent the criteria from being pushed if it is directly applied against a computed window value.
