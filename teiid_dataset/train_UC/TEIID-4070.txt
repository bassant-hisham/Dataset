Issues with resource adapters with api modules in wildfly
It appears that WildFly has issues with packages spanning modules, which JBossAS did not.

With the simpledb and google spreadsheet translators the api module was simply pulled out of the resource adapter with the same package names.  This leads to odd errors at runtime:

org.teiid.resource.adapter.google.GoogleSpreadsheetConnection: java.lang.ClassCastException: org.teiid.resource.adapter.google.SpreadsheetConnectionImpl cannot be cast to org.teiid.resource.adapter.google.GoogleSpreadsheetConnection

Even though SpreadsheetConnectionImpl does implement GoogleSpreadsheetConnection and both the resource adapter and translator reference the same api module.
