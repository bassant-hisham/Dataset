Polish the teiid  rest generated war
I have 2 aspect thoughts to beautify the rest war login/doc page:
* Change the login type from default BASIC to Client-Login, which like Dashbuilder, once request 
{note}
http://{HOST}:{PORT}/{VDB_BANE}_{VDB_VERSION}/api 
{note}
first will redirect to client login page, rather than pop up a small rough login window.
* Add a top green bar and log(as discussed in TEIIDDES-3006) to api doc page
