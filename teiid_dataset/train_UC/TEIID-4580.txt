ST_PointOnSurface returns point on the boundary of the polygon
Calling ST_PointOnSurface with a polygon argument returns one of the points of the polygon boundary. 

E.g.
{code:sql}
SELECT ST_AsText(ST_PointOnSurface(ST_GeomFromText('POLYGON ((67 13, 67 18, 59 18, 59 13, 67 13))')));
{code}
returns {{POINT (67 13)}}

The spec says
bq. PointOnSurface( ):Pointâ€”A point guaranteed to be on this Surface.

which might not be completely clear, but [several|http://gis.stackexchange.com/questions/76498/how-is-st-pointonsurface-calculated] [sources|http://workshops.boundlessgeo.com/postgis-intro/geometry_returning.html] indicate that "on this surface" means _inside_ the surface.

When running the same query against a postgis instance (not through teiid), the result is {{POINT(63 15.5)}}, which is actually inside the polygon.
