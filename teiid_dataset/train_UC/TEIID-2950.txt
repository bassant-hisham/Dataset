Do not schema-qualify the DDL constraint references if they are within the current schema
The DDL constraint statements now contain the model name in order to qualify the schema.  For example : 

CONSTRAINT FK_Account_ParentId FOREIGN KEY(ParentId) REFERENCES importVDBSrcModel.Account (Id)

Request that the schema be dropped if the reference is within the current schema.
