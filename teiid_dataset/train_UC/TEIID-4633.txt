Odata $expand over Oracle tables generates bad query
Query generated to obtain referenced records ($expand many to one) is generated with parentheses, 

Generated query for Oracle*:
SELECT g_0."CATEGORY_ID", (g_0."CATEGORY_ID", g_0."NAME", g_0."LAST_UPDATE") FROM "SAKILA"."CATEGORY" g_0

Generated query for MySQL is:
SELECT g_0.category_id, g_0.name, g_0.last_update FROM Sakila.category AS g_0

* Note the parentheses enclosing all columns but PK, this raises "ORA-00907: missing right parenthesis".
