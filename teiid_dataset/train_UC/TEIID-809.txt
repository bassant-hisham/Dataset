Path to config file has been remove from deploy.properties and Teiid is looking in the wrong location.
Earlier versions of deploy.properties had this line.

dqp.configFile=./deploy/configuration.xml

This line is gone from the current version of the file, and Teiid is looking in the top level folder, not the ./deploy folder for the configuration.xml
