Provide a means of seeing the generated default update/insert/delete procedure transformations
When a transformation supports updates and defaults are created for Insert, Update, and Delete procedures it would be handy to show what was generated. The user could them modify that starting poin--or even the SELECT--to better suit their needs. It might help them understand messages like:
WARNING: The updatable view query has a non key preserving group PartsOracle.STATUS, which cannot be targeted by INSERT/UPDATE/DELETE operations. 

In this instance, the SELECT query is:
SELECT
		*
	FROM
		PartsOracle.STATUS, PartsOracle.SUPPLIER
	WHERE
		PartsOracle.STATUS.STATUS_ID = PartsOracle.SUPPLIER.SUPPLIER_STATUS
