VDBMetaDataParser has no provision for designer vdb 'entries' 
The class VDBMetaDataParser marshalls and unmarshalls VDB files. Would like to exploit this class in Designer for the same job and replace the current JAXB implementation. However, this class does not support entry elements:

{quote}
'With Designer based VDBs, this element is used to define extra files that are defined inside the VDB archive. Not applicable for Dynamic VDBs.'
{quote}

see https://issues.jboss.org/secure/attachment/12355743/vdb-deployer.xsd from TEIIDDES-1454

Consideration for these entries may have been considered previously, given the following appears at line 429:
{code:java}
// entry
// designer only 
{code}

Can support for such entries be implemented, please?
