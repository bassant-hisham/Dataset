Unable to read class Name of resource adapter
We can read the coinfig properties of any resource adapter (*.rar). However we can not read the ManagedConnectionFactory class name and some other information in resource adapter rars.
Following link explains how to read properties, however mentions that need some modification in teiid subsystem to show class name also.
