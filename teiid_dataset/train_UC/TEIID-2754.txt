DatabaseMetaData reports views as tables
The client already has a check for isVirtual & system table type to report a "system view".

We have a "View" type in our metadata, but we generally do not use it in our metadata code. 

So we either could set the view type on the server (although this seems like a broad change) or add another DatabaseMetaData check for isVirtual & table.
