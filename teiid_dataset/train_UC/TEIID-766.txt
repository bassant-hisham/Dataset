Oracle Spatial Connector is not utilizing function modifiers from Oracle Connector
When attempting to execute any functions that are supported by our Oracle connector implementation against the Oracle Spatial connector, invalid SQL is generated.

This is due to com.metamatrix.connector.jdbc.oracle.spatial.OracleSpatialSQLTranslator.initialize(ConnectorEnvironment env) : void not calling its super.initialize(ConnectorEnvironment env) : void method.  This call is required so that the parent (OracleSQLTranslator) can register its function modifiers.
