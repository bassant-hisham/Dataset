Allow dependent join row value to be split
For some queries having a dependent join row value that spans multiple target tables should be split among those targets.

For example rather than:

(g_0.e1, g_1.e2) IN (<dependent values>))

Use the pre 8.7 form:

(g_0.e1 IN (<dependent values>)) AND (g_1.e2 IN (<dependent values>))
