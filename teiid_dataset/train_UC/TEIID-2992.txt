MongoDB: Offset clause causes MongoDB to crash
MongoDB(version < 2.5.2) will crash when offset clause is used in SQL query.

Althought the bug[1] is in MongoDB (Adding big number into $limit causes Mongodb to shutdown), it is also caused by teiid because it adds max integer into $limit which seems to be unnecessary. 

Sample query: 
{code}
SELECT INTKEY FROM bqt1.smalla ORDER BY INTKEY OFFSET 45 ROWS
{code}
Generated mongo command:
{code}
{ aggregate: "smalla", pipeline: [ { $project: { c_0: "$INTKEY" } }, { $sort: { c_0: 1 } }, { $skip: 45 }, { $limit: 2147483647 } ] }
{code}
