Issues with bigdecimal values and odata
Usage of bigdecimal literals in odata4 translator literals or procedure parameters results in an exception about the facet not being satisfied.

We are also with TEIID-4269 we were allowing more than just trailing 0s to be trimmed from the numeric values.  This results in situations where you could return an entity with a value, but could not look it up by that value (as it would no longer be equal).  We should instead let the facet fail if we can't just trim zeros.
