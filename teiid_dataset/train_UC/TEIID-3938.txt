EdmDate and EdmTimeOfDay output in local timezone
EdmDate and EdmTimeOfDay both assume GMT for incoming string values - however when the convert from Java objects to string they use the local/default Calendar.  So when Teiid is on a server not in GMT date and time value sent via the odata4 translator will likely be wrong.
