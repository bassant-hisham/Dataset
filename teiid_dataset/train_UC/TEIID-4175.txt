Certain nested dependent join structure will cause fewer results than expected
With a query such as:

{code}
SELECT pm1.g1.e1, pm1.g2.e2 from /*+ makeind */ pm1.g1 inner join /*+ preserve */ (/*+ makeind */ pm1.g2 inner join pm1.g3 on pm1.g2.e2 = pm1.g3.e2) on pm1.g1.e1 = pm1.g2.e1
{code}

There will be a join structure like:

{code}
  JoinNode(1) [Dependent] 
    AccessNode(2) 
    JoinNode(3) [Dependent] [MERGE JOIN (ALREADY_SORTED/ALREADY_SORTED)]
      DependentAccessNode(4) 
      DependentAccessNode(5) 
{code}

Such that there is a dependent join as a left child of a merge join that is marked as having that child already sorted.  When there is more than 1 query needed for DependentAccessNode(4), the DependentAccessNode will mistakenly mark the right child as needing to be sorted.
