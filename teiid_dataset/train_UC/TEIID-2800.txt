Teiid Login Issue with special characters
When we try to login to teiid programmatically through datasource, we are having problem with username having special characters.
We are encoding the special character as per url encoding
eg : username %xyz is encoded as %25xyz but teiid does not decode the special character while passing username. So the username passed by teiid is %25xyz which fails authentication as the actual username is %xyz
