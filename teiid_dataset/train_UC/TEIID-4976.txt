criteria duplicated when criteria includes the same columns as dependent join criteria
Submitting a query that uses the same column for the join condition and criteria results in the criteria being duplicated on the dependent side of the join.  

For example:
SELECT * FROM A, B
WHERE B.id = A.id  AND A.id IN ('1','2','3') OPTION MAKEDEP B;

Results in the dependent side query looking like:
SELECT ... FROM B WHERE B.id IN ('1','2','3') AND B.id IN ('1','2','3');

This looks to have already been resolved in later versions, but I was not able to find the original JIRA that would have addressed this issue.
