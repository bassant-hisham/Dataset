When using JNDI to obtain cache, need to support EmbeddedCacheManager 
When building the quick start for infinispan, the test application is using the following injection:

<code>
@Produces
@Resource(lookup = "java:jboss/infinispan/container/teiid-infinispan-quickstart")
private CacheContainer container;
</code>

But when the Infinispan connector tries to get the container from JNDI, getting a ClassCastException: org.jboss.as.clustering.infinispan.DefaultEmbeddedCacheManager cannot be cast to org.infinispan.api.BasicCacheContainer

So the injection must be handling getting the container, for which wasn't taken into consideration.  So the connector-infinispan needs to be changed accordingly.
