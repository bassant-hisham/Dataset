View definition column naming issue
View definition columns that do not have names matching the view columns will not be named correctly if the view layer is preserved and pushed down.

for example:

SELECT MIN(x.count) FROM agg x

will fail with agg defined as

create foreign table smalla (intkey integer); 
create view agg (count integer) as select count(\*) from smalla;

but will function correctly with count(\*) as count
