odbc script reader does not handle extra statement delimiters
If sent the block of statements:

BEGIN;declare "SQL_CUR0x1e4ba50" cursor with hold for select * from pg_proc;;fetch 1 in "SQL_CUR0x1e4ba50"

We'll stop processing at the extra ; after the declare.  

In older branches such as 7.7 we'll attempt to process an empty sql statement, which will throw an exception.
