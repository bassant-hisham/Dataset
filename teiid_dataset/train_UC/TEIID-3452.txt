Better highlighting in the query plan when an identified possible issue is seen
Looking a query plan that's printed in the server log, I see the following line:

"LOW Relational Planner Negation is not supported by source People - People.Person.id < 2 was not pushed"

Can the words "LOW Relational Planner Negation" be rephrased?

The word "LOW" used in the context of the criteria not being pushed down would seem to me to be a possible CRITICAL issue to performance.   And I'm not sure most users will claim to know what Relational Planner Negation means and what its implying on an error message.
