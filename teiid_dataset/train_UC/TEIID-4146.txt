Using JDG Library Mode, unable to perform insert (
Trying to run the JDG local cache quickstart, get the following error when trying to perform an insert:

15:09:34,027 WARN  [org.teiid.PROCESSOR] (Worker1_QueryProcessorQueue12) TEIID30020 Processing exception for request O25SlCY41bD5.6 'TEIID30492 Element StockCache.Stock.StockObject of StockCache.Stock is neither nullable nor has a default value. A value must be specified in the insert.'. Originally QueryValidatorException Request.java:330. Enable more detailed logging to see the entire stacktrace.


The issue is because the StockObject column is set to be NullType.unknown, instead of NullType.Nullable.   This is because the metadata processor in the translator-object is setting it incorrectly.

Workaround:

-  Using Teiid Designer to import the source model and change the null type.
-  use dynamic vdb and define the DDL metadata to set the null type.
