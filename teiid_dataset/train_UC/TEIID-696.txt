Add unit test coverage for use of a procedure variable as non join criteria
Add regression test coverage to verify the following query scenario doesn't result in the referenced procedure variable being pushed to the connector:

SELECT 
	pm1.g1.e1 AS pm1g1e1, 
	pm1.g2.e1 AS pm1g2e1, 
	pm1.g1.e2 AS pm1g1e2, 
	pm1.g2.e2 AS pm1g2e2 
FROM 
	pm1.g1 
	LEFT OUTER JOIN pm1.g2 
		ON pm1.g1.e1 = pm1.g2.e1 
		AND pm1.g2.e2 = VARIABLES.myVar
