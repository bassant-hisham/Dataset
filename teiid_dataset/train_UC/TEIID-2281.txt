Exception when updating Oracle NVARCHAR2 columns (Teiid embedded)
The TEIID jdbc driver returns SQLType of “JAVA_OBJECT” for NVARCHAR, so it throws and exception in Oracle JDBC call “setObject(i,param,TYPE.JAVA_OBJECT)”.

We can reproduce the same exception using the Oracle jdbc driver by making the same setObject call.

This is happening using Teiid embedded but also happens with a dynamic vdb in XML. We have not tried a designer-created vdb.
