Teiid maven build needs to work off of Jboss parent pom
Version 7 of the JBoss parent POM was released today.  Please consider
using this as the parent POM for your Maven builds, because it helps
keep our builds consistent.

Also, be aware that this POM is now in the Public Domain (i.e. no
copyright), and the license setting will be inherited to your POMs
unless overridden.  So make sure your POM contains the correct <license>
settings after updating.

Some other notable changes in this version are that the release profile
is now called "jboss-release".  If you use the maven release plugin this
profile will be called automatically, but if you release manually, then
you should add "-Pjboss-release" to the build command, and the
jboss-parent configuration will generate javadoc jars, and update the
release info in the repository.

The full list of changes in this version is available in jira [1], and
more information about using the POM is available on the github site [2]
