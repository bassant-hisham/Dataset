Logging/message tweaks
The source sql is being redundantly logged in JDBCQueryExecution.

We should continue to refine how odbc/jdbc uncaught exceptions are logged - if it's not clearly a closed connection, then it should be a warning.

If a local connection is tried outside of AS the result is an npe.  A better message should be given.
