Wrong result with bidirectional relationship
From the forum post, two tables that relate to each other:

EmployeeMasterEntity (PK EmployeeID, FK Departments)
OrganizationalUnitEntity (PK OrganizationalUnitID, FK Managers)

With data like:

EmployeeMasterEntity
EmployeeID                       Department
1                                       10000001 
2                                       10000002 
3                                       10000001 
 
OrganizationalUnitEntity
OrganizationaUnitID           UnitManager
10000001                          1
10000002                          2
10000003                          2

Will not return the correct results for a query such as:

http://localhost:8080/odata4/TestOdata.1/InterlemView/EmployeeMasterEntity(3)/Departments?$format=json

This is due to using the wrong relationship for the navigation.
