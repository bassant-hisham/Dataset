Dynamic VDB isLoading state doesnt change on fail
I am deploying a dynamic VDB and polling the isLoading state to determine when the VDB deployment is finished.  

In my case the VDB dataSource is not available.  I can see in the server log that the deployment fails immediately, but the isLoading state remains true.

Is this in error, or what status should we be checking?
