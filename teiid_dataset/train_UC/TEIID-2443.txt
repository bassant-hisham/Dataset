Support Language feature for "With Rollup"
It would be useful to provide the clause 'WITH ROLLUP' in Teiid for analytical type queries. Example:

{code}
Group                Name                 SalesYTD
North America        Northwest            123237.00
North America        Northwest             37534.00
North America        Northwest             48003.00
North America        Southwest            164232.00
North America        Southeast             39667.00
North America        Southeast            105810.00
Europe               France                74569.00
Europe               Germany               59456.00
Pacific              Australia             93403.00
Europe               United Kingdom        78327.00
{code}

With query like 
{code:SQL}
SELECT      [Group], [Name], SUM([SalesYTD]) AS 'Total Sales'
FROM        Table
GROUP BY    [Group], [Name] WITH ROLLUP 
{code}

will produce

{code}
Group                Name                 Total Sales
Europe               France                74569.00
Europe               Germany               59456.00
Europe               United Kingdom        78327.00
Europe               NULL                 212352.00
North America        Northwest            208774.00
North America        Southeast            145477.00
North America        Southwest            164232.00
North America        NULL                 518483.00
Pacific              Australia             93403.00
Pacific              NULL                  93403.00
NULL                 NULL                 824238.00
{code}

4 rows have been added, 3 for sub total of each [Group], and 1 row for grand total.

Teiid needa to build it's analytical function library to be useful in reporting situations.
