ldap post
I created a virtual table from Ldap source table, and I am able to do a odata GET call. When I try to make POST on the same table. It is giving the below errors :
 
{
    "error": {
        "code": "ServerErrorException",
        "message": {
            "lang": "en-US",
            "value": "TEIID30492 TEIID30061 Insert is not allowed on the view LdapView.\"user\".  A procedure may be needed to handle the Insert since: The query defining an updatable view has no valid target for INSERTs."
        }
    }
}
 
My virtual table is a simple (select * from table) statement. and "Suports update" is checked for source and view.  VDB file attached for reference
how do i make a successful post?
Thanks in advance,
