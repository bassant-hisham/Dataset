SQL Server 2008/2012 - incompatible data types in comparison after cast/convert
If user want to cast/convert timestamp-value to time and then use it in comparison, Teiid throws an Exception:
"SQLServerException: The data types datetime and time are incompatible in the greater than operator."

Expected behavior:
The query should return correct result as the SQL Server is able to handle similar queries (teiid does not have any problem with same query with oracle, postgres, mysql,...)
