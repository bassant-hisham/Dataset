Modify SOAP War to Allow for Multiple Connection Type Support
Currently, the SOAP war can only connect to the MMDriver. This precludes connection to an embedded Teiid instance. The connection pool and VDB resource logic needs to change to specify which connection type to use (JDBC, JNDI, ?) and format the connection URL accordingly. A properties file would be ideal for specifying the connection type and URL format rather than storing the information in  the web.xml as we have in the past. This Jira is a result of the following posting in the Teiid forum: http://www.jboss.org/index.html?module=bb&op=viewtopic&p=4225928#4225928
