Define/Provide ways to create and use encrypted passwords in Teiid
Teiid runtime is capable of decrypting the encrypted passwords from the Teiid Designer (when the same key certs are used), however does not provide a mechanism to provide a utility to encrypt passwords itself. Often times the Designer might be using a different certificate or may be the user did not use the Designer at all. So, Teiid needs

1) Script to create a new certificate for password encryption
2) Script to encrypt a given password
3) Integration of the this cert with runtime, such that it can decrypt password(s) at runtime.
4) Documentation as how this can be done.
