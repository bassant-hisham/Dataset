System Host setup issues
1) izpack does not make the startserver, stopserver, scripts as executable in the linux

2) There  is no option for *not* starting the server (either way it   does not look like starting the server). This option should be extended to "setupmm" driven process too, with additional property.

3) multicast port is not available in the IZpack + it is hard coded;  Any two machines are seeing each other on the same multicast address. This needs to be fixed as soon as possible.(FEDERATE-340)

4) System name is always defaulting to $hostname, even when it is  blank.  I fixed this in install.

5) With "systenhostsetup.sh" I can not pass in the properties file, it is looking for the file in a fixed location.

6) systemhostsetup.sh creates the "metamatrix.properties" file, but  does not write to the configuration about what it's config name is, thus never can be started.
