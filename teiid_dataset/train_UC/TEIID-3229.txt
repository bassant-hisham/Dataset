Inappropriate pushdown of a must pushdown function
If a must push down function is used over a grouping that is not pushed, then an invalid symbol will be created and cause an invalid source query and or a class cast exception.

For example:

select some_funct(c1) from tbl group by c1

where the translator does not support grouping.
