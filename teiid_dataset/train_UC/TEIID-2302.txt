Issues setting up Teiid as an XA datasource in AS 7
Ran across 2 issues when trying to setup Teiid as a XA data source based on the teiid-xa-ds.zml in the jboss kit:  docs/teiid/datasources/teiid/teiid-xa-ds.xml

1 - ClassNotFound for the org.hibernate.dialect.Dialect, so added: 
   <module name="org.hibernate"/>
   to the teiid/client/main/module.xml

2 - seeing this error:  TEIID10006 Decryption failed: java.lang.ClassNotFoundException   org.teiid.client.util.ExceptionHolder from [Module "org.jboss.jts:main"  but that was resolved after I changed security from:

        <security>
            <user-name>user</user-name>
            <password>user</password>
        </security>

to:
                    <xa-datasource-property name="User">
                        user
                    </xa-datasource-property>
                    <xa-datasource-property name="Password">
                        user
                    </xa-datasource-property>
