Error executing the Procedural releational query with out a where clause
I have virtual stored procedure called "p1" which has no input parameters.  When I execute this procedure either via

select * from p1;

in both cases it fails with error

Group has an access pattern which has not been met: group(s) [vm.p1]; access pattern(s) [Access Pattern: Unsatisfied [] History [[]]]

Procedures with no input parameters should not be tested for Access patterns.
