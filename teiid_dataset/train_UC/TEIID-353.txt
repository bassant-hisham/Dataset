rewrite caseexpression as searchedcaseexpression and remove caseexpression from connector api
There is no instance of a connector supporting case, but not searched case - and we are already currently treating case a searched case in default translations.  It would be best to cannonicalize and remove case expression altogether.

The current rewrite for case expression is not correct either.  Null values for case operands should not result in is null searched case criteria.
