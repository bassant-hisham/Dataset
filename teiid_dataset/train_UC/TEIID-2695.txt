Unable to use CASE statement in Select
Trying to add a <mask> of:

<permission>
      <resource-name>Stocks.StockPrices.Price</resource-name>
     <mask>CASE WHEN hasRole('prices') THEN Price END</mask>
 </permission>

even tried using "= true" just to see

but it it always returns null for Prices.

To test it, I logged in as 'user' using CommandLog vdb and issued:

Select VDB, CASE WHEN hasRole('prices') THEN 'Y' Else 'N' END as V from TEIID_COMMANDLOG

and 'N' was always returned for column V.

teiid roles file:
# A roles.properties file for use with the UsersRolesLoginModule
# username=role1,role2
portfolio=superuser
viewonly=readonly
user=user,prices
