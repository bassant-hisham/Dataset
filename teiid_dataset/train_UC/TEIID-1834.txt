Add support for a comparable binary type
Teiid currently lacks a binary/varbinary type.  Since we have both blob/clob, it would be natural to also introduce a varbinary analog to string.  It would be a comparable type and need an escape syntax for entering literals.  Translators would need to be modified to account for binary literals.

See the forum post for current workarounds.  We also as a one off have previously allowed clob types to be comparable, see also TEIID-1248.  Another approach would by to allow clob/blob to comparable in Teiid, but possibly not at the source as per the searchability metadata.  We would still need to support an escape syntax and modify translators to use native type information and the appropriate literal format.  The advantage of this latter approach is that there is nothing more that designer must do to support this case.  The most practical benefit from introducing a varbinary type would be in having a better size estimate (it would be limited to 8000 bytes) for buffering.
