teiid-8.1.0.Alpha2-jdbc-jdk15.jar - java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java/sql/RowIdLifetime
I'm trying to create a new connection in the BOXI Universe Designer (3.1 SP3) which is using java 1.5.  Using the teiid-8.1.0.Alpha2-jdbc-jdk15.jar in the connection, we're getting 'CS: Java Exception : java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: java/sql/RowIdLifetime' when testing the connection.  I can go into the registry and change a setting to point to 1.6 which works but I'd rather not do that as SAP says they won't support any problems that might cause with something else. Steve Hawkins replied: 'I believe our 1.5 support has been out of date since https://issues.jboss.org/browse/TEIID-2004 an issue/fix will be needed.  Can you log a JIRA?'
