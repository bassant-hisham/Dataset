In case a Delimited Flat file , contains a "Dot" character in any of the column names, we get an issue during Virtual Data Base deployment -

Root cause -

org.teiid.api.exception.query.QueryParserException: TEIID31100 Parsing error: Encountered "'UTF-8') COLUMNS [*]\"name.full\"[*] STRING," at line 1, column 126.

Invalid simple identifier format: [name.full]

 

The query is : SELECT A."name.full",A."surname" FROM (EXEC tabwithdot.getFiles('tab.csv')) AS F, TEXTTABLE(TO_CHARS(F.file,'UTF-8') COLUMNS "name.full" STRING,"surname" STRING delimiter '    ' quote ' ' HEADER) AS A

 

Please note, that although the column name [name.full], is enclosed in Double Quotes, still this issue is observed.

If there was instead any other special character, that works successfully.
