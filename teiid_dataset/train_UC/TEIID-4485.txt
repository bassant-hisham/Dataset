import-vdb VDB name case-sensitive
I have built couple of VDBs using designer, their names are all CAPS and wanted to import these 2 VDBs as views in my 3rd VDB. As the VDB name is cases insensitive in connect string i used lower case to connect to the VDB to do JDBC import. After i completed my 3rd VDB when i tried to deploy the VDB onto the server it is going into INACTIVE state, after changing my connection string to upper case and reimporting the VDB i was able to deploy the 3rd VDB and it state turned to ACTIVE.

The VDB import definition seem's to be case sensitive and this may be the cause of the errors.
I haven't tested this in Dynamic VDB.
