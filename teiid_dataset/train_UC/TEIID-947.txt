UNION query with different datatypes on each side of UNION is producing inconsistent results 
The following query is producing unexpected results in CTC.  It is not consistent and sometimes produces unexpected results and sometimes passes.  However, it can be reproduced.

SELECT IntKey, IntNum FROM BQT1.SmallA UNION SELECT StringKey, StringNum FROM BQT2.MediumB ORDER BY IntKey

The datatypes of each side of the union are not the same and sometimes rmdata.getColumnTypeName(++col) indicates its a string and sometimes it says its an integer.

It is my understanding that the column should be implicitly converted to a consistent type (in this case a string).
