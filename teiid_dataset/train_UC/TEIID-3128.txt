Please refer to this forum thread for exact analysis/details: https://developer.jboss.org/thread/248796

Steps to reproduce at my end:
1) Use tables Account and Contact where AccountId in Contact is the child field for Id in Account.
2) Execute the queries as shown in the steps below
3)Execute the query: SELECT Account.Phone, Account.Name, Account.Type, Contact.LastName FROM Account, Contact WHERE Account.Id = Contact.AccountId (GIVES ERROR)

-Changing the order of the From part makes it run fine
