View removal with lateral join results in error
Using a lateral join:

SELECT CAST(g1.col AS string), g0.a FROM (select 'a' as a, ('a',) as c) AS g0, TABLE(select array_get(g0.c, 1) as col) AS g1

such that the left side is defined by a constant query, the view removal will not fully replace the correlated references and result in an exception for getting the correlated values (g0.c).
