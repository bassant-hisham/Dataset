Unable to import Teiid VDB metadata in OBIEE admin tool using ODBC connection
Unable to import Teiid VDB metadata in OBIEE admin tool using ODBC connection

I am working on 32 bit windows, have installed psqldriver, created a new ODBC data source using PostGreSQL Unicode driver.

But now when I try to import metadata in OBIEE admin tools:

1) It connects to Teiid VDB. 
2) Shows me list of tables and views.

3) But when I try to expand or import table/view its does not show any column.

Even in OBIEE admin tool, if I update rwocount it does successfully but missing columns is an issue.
