Add constant cohersion to rewriter for comparison criteria.
From a recent discussion with Larry, it would be good for the rewriter to handle situations like:

"convert(col, type1) = constant of type2" => "col = constant of type1", where type1 is something other than string.

We already have resolver logic to do this and in many circumstance failing to apply the narroring conversion would indicate a failing comparison.
