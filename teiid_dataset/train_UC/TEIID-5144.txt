Infinispan hotrod translator doesn't overcome error in unrelated proto-schema
Infinispan Hotrod translator can't overcome an error in any proto-schema on the JDG server.

It ends with a message, that there's an issue with a proto-schema. Doesn't say which.

Note, that this can be completely unrelated proto-schema to Teiid. Then the only solution is to reload JDG, or possibly clear proto-schema cache.

If Teiid is checking for errors in .errors cache, it should be selective and look only for the newly added proto-schema.
