Salesforce issues
In looking into other issue two small salesforce issues cropped up:

1. setting modelAuditFields requires using the translator property - the import property is ignored.  This also doesn't seem to be documented.

2. Creating a join where fields are omitted from the child result in a malformed query:
SELECT Account.Name FROM Account LEFT OUTER JOIN Contact ON Account.Id = Contact.AccountId
