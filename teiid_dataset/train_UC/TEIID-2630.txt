SAP reponds with a 401 html page with bad or missing credentials
With bad or missing credentials, SAP will respond back with an html page:

<html><head><title>Logon Error Message</title>...

which if passed into xmltable or other xml processing logic will give a parsing error, rather than an indication of what happened.
