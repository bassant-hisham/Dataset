Don't batch more rows than is needed when query contains limit but translator does not support limit
Teiid shouldn't try to batch more rows than is needed when query contains limit and translator does not support limit.


For example, say there is a translator that exposes a table "A", but does not support limit.

select * from A limit 2

will currently select an entire batch of rows (1024?) from A, instead of just stopping after 2 rows.

Likewise, if the translator supports neither offset nor limit, and the query contains both, Teiid should not try to batch more that (offset + limit) rows.

This is marked as "Minor" because the workaround of naively supporting limit and offset within a translator is not too hard.
