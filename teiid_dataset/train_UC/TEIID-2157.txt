Need ability to push down LIMIT clause to Sybase
Want to add the ability to push down LIMIT clause to Sybase, but it is not
supported as of now, becasue the LIMIT translation capability is
disabled.
SybaseExecutionFactory#supportsRowLimit returns false and it is
hard-coded. If it returns true, EDS can push down
LIMIT to Sybase translating it to TOP clause, since SybaseExecutionFactory has translateLimit
method which translate the LIMIT to TOP clause. The customer want a
property which can be switched on the limit translation easily than
writing java code.
