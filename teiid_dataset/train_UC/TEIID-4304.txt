Correct handling with subquery in on clause
With the translator capability supportsSubqueryInOn false, we can still plan a query with a subquery in the on clause if non-join criteria on the inner side of a left outer join is used in the user query on clause (it is temporarily pushed out of the join and then added back in rule collapse source).

Additionally the oracle translator should not support subquery in on for oracle 11 and earlier.
