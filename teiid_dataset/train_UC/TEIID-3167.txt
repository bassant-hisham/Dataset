Enhance TEXTTABLE to support TRIM as a configurable option for Delimited Text Files
In case of Delimited text files, currently, we always TRIM the input data.
The enhancement request is to make this behaviour configurable, and let user determine, whether the leading or trailing spaces for the column text should be trimmed or not.
