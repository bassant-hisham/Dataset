Informix translator - convert function in definition of view is not pushed down
I defined a view (see definition below). When I try to select all rows from the view, teiid/informix jdbc driver throws an exception.

Teiid DDL:
{code:sql}
CREATE VIEW U6 (StringCol string,
    IntCol integer)
  AS
    SELECT CONVERT(BQT1.SmallA.IntNum, string) AS StringCol, BQT1.SmallA.IntNum AS IntCol
    FROM BQT1.SmallA
    UNION ALL
    SELECT BQT1.SmallB.StringNum, CONVERT(BQT1.SmallB.StringNum, integer)
    FROM BQT1.SmallB;
}
{code}

Query:
{code:sql}
SELECT * FROM VQT.U6
{code}

Source-specific query
{code:sql}
SELECT g_1.intnum AS c_0, g_1.intnum AS c_1 FROM smalla AS g_1 UNION ALL SELECT g_0.stringnum AS c_0, g_0.stringnum AS c_1 FROM smallb AS g_0
{code}

Actual exception:
{code:text}
Caused by: java.sql.SQLException: The statement failed because corresponding column data types must be compatible for each UNION, INTERSECT, or MINUS query.
