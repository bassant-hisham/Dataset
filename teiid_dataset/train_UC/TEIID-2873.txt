VDB re-deploy issue with VDB that auto-generates REST wars
I've encountered an issue when re-deploying a VDB that auto-generates and deploys REST wars.  On re-deploy of the VDB, the REST wars don't always get deployed. 

Steps to reproduce and server.log is attached.

Note this is on deploy of the VDB over an existing deployment.  Workaround would be to explicitly un-deploy the VDB before doing the deploy.
